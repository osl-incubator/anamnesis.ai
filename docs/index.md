# anamnesis.ai

This project aims to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an AI-driven
anamnesis collection system in the healthcare domain. The system will leverage
the capabilities of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), the
ChatGPT API, Flask (a micro web framework written in Python), and SQLite (a
lightweight database) to facilitate an interactive, user-friendly platform for
collecting patient medical history (anamnesis) through conversational AI.
