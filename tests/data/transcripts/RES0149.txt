D: How may I help you?

P: Hi I um I just developed uh or I guess I just started having difficulties with uh breathing starting this morning. It was just very odd, I was fine yesterday night and then just this morning, I've had a really hard time breathing um and yeah, I thought I should come in and get it checked out. I don't know what's going on.

D: Yeah, certainly, and so uh like did this shortness of breath wake you uh like did you wake up, um like just like uh to kind of sit up to catch your breath, um or when did the shortness of breath start?

P: Um it was kind of after I woke up and I was sort of, um just walking around that I I noticed that I was feeling short of breath just walking around, which was so weird. You know that that doesn't really happen to me.

Uhm, actually now that I think about it, it's it's kind of there even when I'm like breathing normal, but it's not as bad. When I take a deep breath it's like really, really bad or when I um yeah, when I like cough or like I'm laughing or something, it just gets really bad.

D: OK, so that was all I wanted to ask today on on history and before I went on to uh the physical exam, we want to check uh vital signs and have a listen to your heart and lungs and um measure the diameter of your of your shins as well. Um but um it'll be important to get uh some imaging of your of your lungs um to assess whether or not there's a pulmonary embolism um uh because that would be one of the more um life threatening, or potentially um complicating uh causes of what's going on right now.

P: Sure.
