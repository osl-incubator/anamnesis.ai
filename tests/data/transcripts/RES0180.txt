D: No, OK. Uhm alright, I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?

P: I was just well worried about Covid and was just wondering what I should do.

D: Yeah, for sure. So we are, you're a lot of your symptoms do overlap with those of Covid, so we are going to take a swab today and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but you should isolate for 14 days. And that includes from family family members if possible. Uhm, and basically just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they get worse, or you're having like neurological symptoms, you should seek help from the ER, but otherwise keep yourself hydrated, eat well. If you have a humidifier in the basement, use it, and for your fevers you can take antipyretics like Tylenol. And just it's it's just a lot of supportive care. How does that sound and obviously like if your symptoms aren't going away after like a few weeks, call us back and it could be something like bacterial, in which case we can give you some antibiotics.

P: OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

D: Yeah, no problem.
