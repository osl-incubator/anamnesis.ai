P: No. 

D: OK, has anyone at your work been sick as well? 

P: No, I haven't really noticed anyone being sick.

D: OK, OK, well those were the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?

P: No, I I was just wondering what this can be.

D: Um yeah, so the first thing we want to rule out as covid because a lot of your symptoms overlap with those of covid, so we'll take a swab and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

D: OK. Great, no problem.
