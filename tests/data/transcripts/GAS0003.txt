D: What brings you in here today? 

P: Yeah hi, I'm I I have a pain in my belly. It started a couple hours ago.

D: OK, and where exactly in your belly do you have this pain?

P: It's mostly up here on the right side.

D: The right side, OK and can you describe what kind of pain is it? Is it like a dull pain or sharp pain, an aching pain? 

P: Oh I guess it's a, it's an aching pain I'd say. It kind of just, um, it would initially just come and go, but now it's just it's staying. It's not going away.

D: OK, and so it's in the right area and does it travel anywhere elsewhere besides on from the right side?

P: No. 

D: OK. And on a scale of 1 to 10, one being the least amount of pain you felt in your life, and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it right now?

P: It's about to a 10, an 8 maybe.

D: An 8, OK and so just to clarify, when did it start?

P: About 8 hours ago.

D: 8 hours ago, OK. And were you doing anything before? Like, did you have a meal or how were you sleeping before it woke you up, what was going on before you had the pain?

P: I was just about to go to sleep. I wasn't doing anything in particular at the time.

D: OK. And has it been getting worse since it first started?

P: Oh yeah, definitely it would come and go, but now for the past I'd say five to six hours, it's been constant, just there all the time. 

D: OK. And have you had any similar pain like this in the past?

P: Yeah, uh I I have the same pain that sort of comes and goes after I eat. Usually after I've had something like a something fatty, something from outdoors, maybe like a burger or fries or something. I initially thought it was indigestion, but I don't I don't know what's going on now.

D: OK, and does it, does anything make it better or worse or anything that you've tried?

P: Well, I guess eating sometimes makes it worse, um, but I don't I don't think there's anything that's making it better.

D: OK, have you tried any medications at all?

P: I tried Tylenol but that didn't do anything.

P: Yes, so initially it would come and go, but now, so for the first 2 hours it would come and go. And when I would have this pain when I was eating, it would come and go. But over the past six hours it's just been constant. 

D: OK. Alright.
