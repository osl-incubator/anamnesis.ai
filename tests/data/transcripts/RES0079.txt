D: OK, and has she had any symptoms?

P: She's been fatigued since coming back, but I mean, we thought that was maybe just from the travels, but, maybe not.

D: Has she been quarantining, or are you both spending time together?

P: Well, we've been, I mean, trying to distance in the home, but I mean, we've been living together in an apartment so.

D: Alright, OK, so if I understand correctly, you've been feeling tired and you've had a cough and a runny nose and changes in your sense of smell for the past three or four days and you also were feeling a little bit hot and yesterday you noticed that you had spiked a high fever. Is there anything that I'm missing?

P: No, I think that covers all the symptoms.

D: And you might have potentially had, some exposure through your girlfriend potentially, so it's possible that, well, it's possible that you just have a cold, but it's also,  we'll still have to rule out covid as a cause, and so we'll have to do a covid swab and go from there and we'll check your temperature here as well. Just, uh, I think something that I forgot to ask, have you taken any medications that has helped you with your symptoms?

P: Uh no, I haven't taken anything.

D: OK, alright, well, thank you, I'll go talk to my attending and we'll come back and discuss this further with you.

P: That sounds great. Thank you.
