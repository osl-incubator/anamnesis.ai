D: I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in.

P: Sure, um, I have been coughing a lot. I've been feeling short of breath and I just feel really wheezy, so I thought I should come check it out.

D: OK, when did the cough start?

P: I've always had a cough. Well, I guess I've had a cough for the past five years, but over the past three days it's gotten a lot worse.

D: OK, did anything happen 3 days ago that has brought the cough on?

P: Uhm, no, I was, I did groceries, I came home and then I started coughing a little bit more and I haven't been able to stop since.

P: Uhm, I guess walking, doing day to day things has made me feel a little bit more short of breath than I used to feel.

D: OK. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms besides the cough, wheeze and shortness of breath?

P: Um, I feel a little bit more tired, but other than that, no.

D: OK. So a bit more tired. How has your sleep been?

P: My sleep has been, um, pretty normal. It's been, yeah, it's been the same. I guess it's the coughing that's making me tired.

D: OK, do you get chest pain when you exert yourself physically?

P: Uhm, no.

D: OK, so it's just after the coughing?

D: Any allergies to medications?

P: No.

D: OK. Are your immunizations up to date?

P: I believe so, but I recently learned that I should get something called the pneumococcal vaccine. I haven't gotten that yet.

D: Yeah, you're you're right. So for um, in Canada or anybody or in Ontario, at least, anybody who's older than 65, it's recommended to get this vaccine to protect against certain types of bacterial infections type which can cause pneumonia. So it would be good something that you can set up with your family doctor.

P: OK.

D: Yeah, and so are you, so do you smoke cigarettes?

P: I used to.

D: OK, and how much do you smoke or how much did you use to smoke?

P: Um, I smoked a pack a day and I smoked for 45 years, but I stopped two years ago.

P: Uhm, no.

D: Alright, and anybody in the family have a heart or lung condition?

P: Um, no.

D: Any cancers in the family?

P: Um, there was a liver cancer.

D: OK, and, I think that.. OK, and that was all I wanted to ask on history. Was there anything else that you wanted to tell me today?

P: Um, no, just um, what do you think the problem is? I've never felt this bad with my shortness of breath before.

D: Yeah, certainly so umm, it, it sounds like it could be maybe a viral infection that I brought on this cough and worsen the sputum. This could be a bacterial infection, it could be a COPD exacerbation and also one of the other things that we would have to consider right now is Covid as well and so we will do a PCR nasal swab for Covid and a chest Xx-ray and some other investigations as well and uhm, we will try to get to the bottom of what's causing your your shortness of breath.

P: OK, that sounds good, thank you.
