D: Would you mind by start starting to tell me about what brought you in today? 

P: Yeah, I I. It's just over the last week I can't like do anything without just feeling really like short of breath. I'm having a really hard time breathing. Like kind of do anyways because I have COPD. So I feel like over a few years it's been getting worse, but this week it just got really bad in particular.

D: OK, I see so. How much activity were you doing that was bringing on, the shortness of breath?

P: Like I, I usually I will walk my dog around the block and I haven't been able to do that like my husband's been doing it. And then I was just going to try to get the mail just like. I don't know. It's probably like 200 feet down the road and I could, I was so tired when I got back and I felt like I could barely breathe.

D: OK, and did you have any chest pain with this?

P: Uh. No, no, nothing like that.

D: OK, and when did the shortness of breath symptoms start coming on?

P: Mmm like it I've been. I feel like it's been sort of getting worse over the past few years. But just like a week ago, it just got really bad. Like very suddenly.

D: OK, um, and has it been getting worse over this past week or has it stayed the same?

P: Pfft maybe getting a bit worse, like it's been pretty bad the whole time.

D: No, OK, I see, and have you had a cough?

P: Yeah, like I again like I do normally because of my COPD but. It's just been really. It's been even worse this week, and usually when I get sick it's more like I'm like bringing up a lot of like yellowish gunk, but this time it's not been quite as like gunkie. It's been pretty dry.

D: OK, so you're not bringing up any sputum with your cough?

P: No, maybe maybe a tiny bit, but I kinda do that like anyways. 

D: OK. Uh, and have you coughed up any blood?

P: No. 

D: OK, and um, have you had any other symptoms that have went along with this difficulty breathing, um and cough?

P: Um I mean I've been, I don't have a thermometer at home, but I have felt like really hot. And. Just this morning, like my husband, you know he was trying to make sure I was still eating and drinking a lot and I don't really feel like I am tasting my food all that well.

D: OK, so would you say that you have a loss of taste right now?

P: Um pretty yeah yeah, I'm pretty sure I couldn't really taste my breakfast. 

D: OK. And how about your sense of smell?

P: Actually, yeah come to think of it, I don't. I don't think I've really been smelling much.

D: OK, so you're not able to smell either. Do you feel like your nose is congested or are really runny?

P: It's not, it's not particularly congested or anything. 

D: OK. But still have had these changes in taste and smell.

P: Mmmm

D: Um OK and we will check your temperature as well to see if we can, if there is a documented fever. Have you had any night sweats?

P: Oh no, I haven't had that.

D: OK, how about any chills? So it could be like when you kind of shaking in your in your bed.

D: OK, and have over the last several months. Have you had any weight loss?

P: No, I think I've been pretty well the same.

P: Oh, maybe once you're once a week.

D: OK um. And when what types of situations where you finding yourself needing to use it more often? Or rather where there any kind of triggers to those events?

P: Like if I if I say I took my dog for a walk and they kind of got away and I had to run a little like run a little bit. Usually I walk like pretty fast but if I have to run that would that would make it, would make me have to use it.

D: OK, so a lot more exertion than what you're able to do now it sounds like.

P: Yeah, like heavier exercise.

Or you could have a bacterial infection that's not Covid really related at all Or this could be an exacerbation of your COPD and maybe We need we need to just titrate your inhaler so we'll need to. Just run some lab work and do the PCR nasal swab as part of the work up an we will see what some of those investigations show.
