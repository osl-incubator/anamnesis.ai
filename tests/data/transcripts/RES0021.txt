D: OK, excellent, so with your symptoms of having a kind of a fever, cough, and being tired, definitely concerned of viral infection and possibly COVID-19 or something more common, like the common cold, like an adenovirus. And so will do some testing for for COVID-19 with a nasal PCR swab as well as run some blood work. Um because there is a possibility that there's a bacterial infection, such as like a pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection that would be treated with antibiotics so. We uh yeah, we'll order those investigations along with a chest X Ray. And we will go from there.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you so much.
