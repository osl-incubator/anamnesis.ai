D: No OK alright yeah so those are just a few questions I had I'll call your mom back in. OK, so yeah, we're just gonna try and do a couple of examinations. So are you able to stand up by yourself?

P: Um I can, but I need a lot of assistance like I have to hold on to the desk or have a crutch or something like that.

D: OK, uh, no worries and then while laying down, are you able to lift your right leg with your knees straight?

P: I don't know about straightening my knees. My leg seems to have permanently turned outward and look shorter than my other leg.

D: OK and yeah, I forgot to ask you this earlier. I don't I don't think we weighed you when you were coming in, but approximately how much would you say you weigh?

P: I weigh about um 130 pounds.

D: OK, and do you know how tall you are?

P: Uhm I'm about 4'8".

D: OK. OK, alright, so yeah those were just some of the questions I had today we'll do a full physical examination and have you come in. Alright, sorry and like well will continue with the full examination today and what currently it seems like it can definitely be from the fall. You may have injured yourself and we just want to make sure there's no fractures like a hip fracture.

P: OK.

D: One thing that's also something that we have to investigate is something called slipped capital femoral epiphysis. So this is, this is a common hip issue in adolescents, especially from boys aged 10 to 16. And usually it's the left hip that's affected, but it it can be the right. And as adolescents are in a phase where they were growing, there is, if they have some predisposed disposition too slipping of the capital femoral if epiphysis, which is right between your hips, you can get some slipping. It can be after a fall or it can happen just as the child is growing, and it can also it is also associated with the increasing weight that a child may have. So what we can do is just get first an X-Ray of both the hips.

P: OK.

D: And see like what we can find on the X-Ray and then will also do a full examination. And it, if it does turn out that there is a fracture or there's a slipped capital femoral epiphysis we will need to send out a referral to pediatric orthopedic surgery.

P: OK.

D: Yeah, so yeah, first we'll just get the image Ng done and see what's going on in there and then we'll get back to you shortly.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you so much.

D: Welcome. Take care.
