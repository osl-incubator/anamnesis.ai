P: I'm pretty normal. I'm not limping.

D: OK. And. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask and and check today. Did you have any questions?

P: Just what do you think is going on with my feet and how do I get some sensation back?

D: So it does sound like it could be related to diabetes where what happens is you get like a peripheral neuropathy overtime and you can lose sensation to your feet in a glove and stocking distribution, which sounds like the history history you're saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well. 

P: Mmmm

D: Where you lose sensation and you can't feel pain. And so But other things to consider could be. Possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that, but I would be much much lower down on the differential. And. So to regain sensation I think. Really, the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves, and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and. Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing. And so if there are any, is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important. As we're working on improving the diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could could also help as well.

P: OK OK, thank you.
