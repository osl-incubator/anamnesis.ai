P: No, I'm just um, I've been monogamous with my partner now for uh over 10 years and um no concerns for uh an STI at this time.

D: OK, alright good, um so now we're just going to move on to the physical exam part um of this interview. Um so I'm going to get you to look at both your arms, hands, and wrists, um side by side. Does your left one seem at all more red, swollen, uh or hot.

P: No, no symptoms like that.

D: No, OK. And um do you, does that one seem to be more atrophied or are there any deformities or skin changes on that one?

P: Um maybe uh a little less muscle bulk on the, like where my thumb is.

D: OK, OK. Um and then I'm gonna get you to palpate certain areas of that arm. So let's start um at the top, when you when you press down on your shoulder blades or just at the very top of your um arm where your, or at the very top where your arm connects to your shoulder, does it hurt over there?

P: No, no pain there.

D: OK. So no pain on the acromion process or the scapula. Um any pain where your biceps are?

P: No.

D: No, OK. How about at your elbows?

P: Uh no pain at the elbows and full, I can move my elbows and shoulders, uh no problem either. And my neck doesn't hurt at all either, I can move my neck around.

D: How about when you um palpate your wrists, both sides, medial and lateral?

P: Uh, yeah no, no pain if I'm just pressing or palpating the wrist.

D: OK. Um and I'm going to get you to um straighten out your arm and flex at your shoulder and extend at your shoulder, does that hurt?

P: No.

D: How about when you flex your elbow and extend your elbow?

P: No.

D: Um how about when you flex your wrist and extend your wrist?

P: No.

D: OK, so I'm going to do a special test for something called carpal tunnel syndrome. Um so um I'm gonna get you to straighten out your left arm again um and right where um alright, how do we do this? OK, so with your right hand or with your yeah, with your right index finger and middle finger, you're going to tap um just below uh where the bulk of your thumb muscles are um connecting to your wrist. I'm just going to get you to tap that area. Do you feel tingling like an electric shock sensation in your hand or anything like that.

P: I do, yeah.

D: You do, OK, so that's a positive Tinel's sign. Um and then we're going to do one more test, so I'm going to, OK so make like a prayer motion with your hands like um putting your 2 palms together and then um and then instead invert your hand so that the outer parts are touching and your fingers are pointing towards the ground.

P: OK.

D: So kind of like upside down but with your outer parts of your hands touching. Um and then I'm going to get you to uh just hold your arms like that um for about 60 seconds. Do you feel any tingling, numbness, or pain in those fingers?

P: Yeah, I get a bit of uh numbness and tingling when when I do that.

D: OK, so that's a positive Phalen's sign test. Um alright, so that brings me to the end of um this interview, did you have any questions or concerns, anything that you wanted to bring up?

P: Uh just wondering about um what this could be.

D: Oh yeah, so um it seems like you have something called carpal tunnel syndrome. Um and that is, it's pretty common um so it can be caused by um a lot of things, but basically your median nerve runs through your forearm into your wrist, and anything that squeezes or irritates that median nerve can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, um and some things include um like repetitive movements at work, um obesity, um any nerve damaging conditions like diabetes, um inflammatory conditions, but mostly just like workplace factors can can do it, um especially if you're working with like vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires like repetitive and prolonged flexing of the wrist. Um so uh diagnosis, we just do that through like symptoms, physical exam, um we don't really need to do any imaging at this at this point. And to treat it um basically work modification, so taking frequent breaks, uh not doing those repetitive movements um as often um and then you can do things at home, like apply cold packs. Um and then we also have some like non-surgical treatments where we can uh splint, we can put like a wrist splint um while you sleep to relieve those nighttime symptoms. Uh you can take some NSAIDs to relieve pain, um and if those don't work, we can try corticosteroids, um and if that doesn't work, then we can also discuss surgery sometime down the line. Does that sound OK?

P: It does, yeah, thank you.

D: Yeah no problem.
