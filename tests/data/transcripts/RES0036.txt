D: Can we just begin with what brings you in here today?

P: Yeah, so I've been pretty breathless for the past six days and it's it's just worse. I have to stop from, I had to stop so many times walking here from my car.

D: OK, and when did this first start?

P: Six days ago.

D: And did it start like gradually or was it all of a sudden?

P: Bah, pretty sudden actually.

D: OK, and were you doing anything before it first happened?

P: No. Just work and spending some time at home.

D: OK, and so you're having the shortness of breath, but are you having any like coughing at all?

P: Oh yeah, a lot of coughing too, yeah.

D: OK, and is it a dry cough or a wet cough?

P: Um, so I've noticed this weird rusty colored sputum and I've noticed that like a couple times a day.

D: And did your cough started around the same time as when your shortness of breath started?

P: Uhm, yeah, I'd say so. 

D: OK, so around six days?

P: Yeah around there.

D: And has it been constant like I've been constantly having a shortness of breath every day with the coughing? Or does it come and go? 

P: Um? It's pretty constant now.

D: OK, and do you find that it's been getting worse at all? 

P: Uhm, yeah, I'd say it's getting, I'd say it's getting worse.

D: OK, and is that both the coughing and the shortness of breath or one or the other?

P: It's, it's both. 

D: It's both OK.

P: Yeah.

D: And do you remember if you were doing something at the time when the shortness of breath first started? Have you recently had any infections or anything like that previously?

P: I don't know bout an infection. Um, but I guess I have been feeling a little feverish. I haven't taken my temperature, but I've been feeling you know, kind of cold.

D: OK. And when you feel the breathlessness, how long does it usually last for?

P: Um, it's kind of hard to say, it's it's always their baseline, but it gets worse when I when I walk or when I exert myself.

D: OK. And besides like the exertion, does it get worse with any when you're near pollen, when you're outside in the cold, anything like that?

P: Um? It gets worse when when no no, I wouldn't say that no, no.

D: OK. And is it worse in the morning or at night?

P: It it doesn't matter.

D: It is there all the time?

P: Yeah. 

D: OK. And is there anything that makes it go away or I mean or anything you've tried that makes it better?

P: Well, I guess I've tried some taking some Tylenol and that's helping my like regulating my temperature. 

D: OK. And have you ever noticed any blood in the cough?

P: It's rusty colored, but I don't know if that's blood.

P: I do have this sharp chest pain that gets worse with coughing.

D: OK and is is that always there or is it just when you're coughing a lot?

P: I guess when I'm coughing a lot. 

D: And that starts six days ago too as well. Or is that?

P: Yeah.

D: OK. And do you ever feel any kind of is it so you said, mention it was sharp, but do you ever feel like increased pressure in your chest? Anything like that? 

P: Uh, no.

D: And how would you rate this pain when it occurs from a scale of 1 being the least amount of pain you've felt in your life, and 10 being the worst? 

P: The sharp chest pain? I'd say maybe like a 7.

D: OK. Alright, is there any other questions or concerns that you had for us today?

P: No. 

D: OK. So yeah, based on what we discussed today, it seems that you may have an upper respiratory tract infection. The other things on differential would be a COPD exacerbation due to your significant smoking history. So we will do some investigations ti figure out what this is, and then perhaps can give you antibiotics or other medications to help you, unless it's a viral infection.
