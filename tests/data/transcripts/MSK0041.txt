D: OK. And so like any movement makes it it worse, is there anything else that makes it worse, like putting socks on or even having I don't know clothing touch it or your shoes touch it?

D: OK. And. OK, and anybody in the family have a history of musculoskeletal or or neurological conditions?

P: Um so. Who OK, so my my father had like arthritis and I don't remember what kind of arthritis he had but he had severe arthritis. He also had high blood pressure and diabetes, and on my mother's side. Um there is some arthritis there as well and as well as gout and kidney stones.

D: OK.  So that that was everything I wanted to ask all the history. And so, uh, next to ask you to have a look at your feet. And are you seeing any swelling, redness, or discolouration?

P: I see some redness and uh, some swelling in that area.

D: OK, and are you feeling any temperature changes?

P: Yes, and the right one is definitely warmer than the left.

D: OK, then how about any muscle atrophy in the foot or or lower leg or any joint malalignment or deformities?

P: Uh, so in terms of deformity is like it just looks swollen and so there's like a big bump on the right side of my foot, whereas it's completely straight on my left, but other than that, no deformities.

D: OK, and if you were to a palpate or press on areas of your foot or joints of your toes, are you feeling any any pains along the top of your foot or or in any of your other toes?

P: None of my other toes.

D: OK, and how about any pains at the ankle?

P: Um no pain at the ankle.

D: OK, so the metatarsals are not having any pain and then the joints of the 2nd 5th digits are pain free along with the ankle as well. Um and when it comes to range of motion, are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose?

P: Yes, I can do that.

D: OK, and how about your ankle, are you able to um move your ankle on a full range of motion.

P: I can.

D: OK, and are you having a limping with, walking or otherwise called an antalgic gait?

P: Somewhat because I'm trying not to put too much weight on my right big toe.

D: OK. Alright, and so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today?

P: Um no just what can I do for my foot how do I make the swelling go down?

D: Yeah, for sure it's so right now with having a like a red, warm and swollen joint that that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. It's important to rule out a septic arthritis, however. Based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes, and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.

D: Alright, thank you, we will get that started.
