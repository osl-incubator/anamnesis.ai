D: Okay, and um, are able to do any movements, or are you just kind of holding your arm up with your other other arm?

P: I, yeah I've just been holding my arm up by, uh, I kind of made a sling out of, yeah, like the coaches helped make a sling out of one of the, uh, what we, like a shirt or something like that at the practice. And so I've been just kind of holding my arm against my chest with my elbow flexed. I haven't really moved it at all.

D: Okay. Um, and what's your living situation like right now?

P: So I live with both of my parents and um, I have a younger brother and a younger sister as well. We live in a, in a house.

D: Okay, alright, and um, do you work currently? Or are you a student?

P: Yeah, I'm in high school and, um, I, I work part-time at the grocery store as well, but uh, it's not that often though, because I've just been been playing sports, on the football team, we have a lot of practices and games and stuff.

D: Okay. Um, do you drink alcohol?

P: Uh I, sometimes I, with friends. Um, we've had a couple of beers here and, here and there, but I mean it's, it's not something that I've done very often. Yeah, we've been pretty safe, I feel like.

D: Okay, and do you smoke cigarettes or marijuana, or use any recreational drugs?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We'll do a full physical examination of the area. Um, we, we will definitely get an x-ray of the shoulder and clavicle to see what kind of, it seems like you have a clavicular fracture from just the mechanism of the injury, as well as everything you were describing. Um, but it is important to understand how, like what kind of clavicle injury it is and where it's affected, if it's in the middle area, on like the outer areas of the clavicle, um, and how much it's displaced because that will determine if we just need to reduce it here, and then give you a sling, and then you can go home. That's usually the case, but sometimes you may require surgery as well, and we would need to refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. So yeah, we'll, we'll get the x-ray done, and if you need anything for pain currently, we will give you some medications here, um and then we'll go from there.

P: Alright, thank you.

D: You're welcome. Um, I'll be here with you shortly.

P: That sounds good. Thank you so much.
