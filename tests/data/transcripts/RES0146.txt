P: My grandfather had lung cancer. He smoked his whole life and yeah, I know my dad had you had a heart attack when he was in his 70s.

D: OK. Alright, well those are all the questions I had for you. We will do a Covid test today simply because your symptoms overlap with some of the symptoms of Covid. It's also possible that you just have a, just the common cold and that would get better over time. You might have caught something from your colleague who was sick last week, so it's great that you've been, instead of isolating yourself and staying away from your wife, I would also recommend, if you haven't already done so to not, I know that the you have symptoms started yesterday evening, but just to try to work from home or take some time off of work for the next couple of days at least until you recover, test results are back in the next 24 to 48 hours and then from there on, follow the advice that you'll be getting from public health.

P: That sounds really good. Yeah, thank you.
