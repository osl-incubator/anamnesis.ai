D: Okay, now that's good. I'm happy to hear that. And uh, is there any um, conditions in the, in the family? Uh, either like musculoskeletal or neurological things that you can think of.

P: Um, I don't think anything related to this, but um, I know my, my dad has diabetes. Um, and my mom has uh, some anxiety.

D: Okay, and anybody in the family ever um, have any cancers or, or any bone tumours or soft tissue um, tumours or growths?

P: Um, I don't think anyone's had like a bone tumour or anything like that. I, I know my uncle, um he, he does have a, he had like melanoma, which he had to get surgically removed.

D: Okay. Um, and any genetic diseases in the family or, or congenital diseases?

P: Um, not that I've been told, no.

D: Okay, um, so um, next I just wanted to move on to the physical exam component and um, firstly, are you having any issues with uh walking?

P: No, I've been like, uh, no, no pain, no. I can walk just fine, no issues there.

D: Okay, excellent. So no antalgic gait. And when looking at um, the area, are you seeing any swelling or, or redness, or skin discolouration?

P: No, no, nothing like that. It's just, uh, I can tell there's like a lump there, and if I press it, I can feel like the hard lump, but um, no changes in the skin above it.

D: Okay, and are you seeing any um, muscle atrophy around the area?

P: No um, nothing like that.

D: Okay, and are you seeing any, uh, like joint deformities or, or anything like that?

P: Um, no, not that I can tell.

D: Okay, um and, uh you don't have any, any pain, so if you press on the area or on the the knee joint, you can just feel the mass and no pain there?

P: Yeah, it just feels weird. I don't, I'm not in any pain or anything, but it's like, it's weird to look at and then weird to feel uh, as well.

D: Okay. Um, and um, uh okay, then no limitations with uh, with like range of motion of any of your joints including like uh, knee and ankle?

P: Yeah no, I can move everything just fine.

D: Okay, awesome and so that, that was everything that I wanted to ask today and uh, uh check on the physical as well. Um, so was there anything else that I maybe forgot to ask about or anything you wanted to add?

P: Yeah no, I um, nothing else I wanted to add, but I, I think my parents and I were just scared about it being like uh, cancer, or like a tumour, um, so I just don't know what I should do, if I need to get any tests done, or x-rays, or anything like that.

D: Okay, um, yeah, we, so um, the first thing we will want to get uh, an x-ray um, of the knee and also of the uh, long bones, so of your femur um, as well as your leg too. Uh, and because right now we, um, most likely think is called something, um, an osteochondroma, um, which is the most common uh, primary benign bone tumour. Um, however, there are other things that it, it could be, um, and so, such as like an osteoma, or um, an endochondroma, um, so we'll, we'll want to um, get that x-ray and um, kind of go, go from there.

P: Okay, uh, yeah that, that sounds good.

D: Alright, so we'll get that, we'll get that ordered.

P: Alright perfect, thank you so much.
