D: Okay, great, and do you have any supports in the home that, that help you with uh, any activities of daily living, like um, either dressing or bathing or making food or even doing some of the shopping?

P: So I am pretty independent for most things. Um, there will be like a CCAC care worker who comes in, uh, once in a while just to help me clean the house.

D: Okay, so once in a while, is this like once a week or once, yeah, how often? 

P: Yeah, once every two weeks.

P: Thank you.

D: So you quit five years ago, and how long did you smoke for and how much did you smoke?

P: Um, I used to smoke, not a lot, just like one or two a day, uh, and I did that for about 25 years.

D: Okay, and uh, do you drink alcohol?

P: Um, I'll have like a glass of wine once in a while.

D: And how often is once in a while? Is this, or how many drinks per week would you say?

P: Um, per week, maybe like three.

D: Okay, um, and any uh, heart or lung conditions that run in the family?

P: Um, yeah so, there is um, like lung cancer, there's asthma, there's uh, COPD. All of that, someone, like my, both sides of my family had.

D: Alright, um, and have you been around any, anybody who's been sick?

P: No, not recently.

D: Alright, and have you traveled anywhere outside of the city, or?

P: Uh, no.

D: Okay, um, so that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything that uh, that you wanted to add?

P: No, those are all questions that I had. Um, do you think um, I need to be hospitalized, um, because I'm very short of breath, or do you think I can just um, stay at home? Do you think I need antibiotics?

D: Yeah, so we'll, we'll check your temperature and, and confirm the fever and um, check your oxygen levels as well. You might need oxygen, um, you're mentioning, with your shortness of breath. Um, and we will get a chest x-ray, and if um, we're seeing consolidation there, suggestive of pneumonia, you may need antibiotics that will cover, cover those, those bugs. However, your symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, and so it will be important to get a, um, COVID swab. But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted.

P: Okay. Okay yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

D: You're welcome.
