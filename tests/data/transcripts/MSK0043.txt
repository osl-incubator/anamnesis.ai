P: No, those feel fine. I can move my hip and ankle okay, and no pain.

D: Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. We'll do like a full physical examination, take a look at your knee, um, and most likely, what this sounds like, is something called septic arthritis. It's uh, it's when there's like an infection that um, can go into your joints and uh, it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um, assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back. And you may also require um, an admission today as well.

P: Okay, uh, thank you. Yeah, that, that sounds good.

D: Alright, yeah, so yeah, we'll get all that done for you shortly, and uh, we'll go from there. 

P: Right, thank you.

D: And um, we might also need an x-ray, so just sit tight. We'll, we'll come call you.

P: Okay, thank you.

D: Alright, you're welcome.
