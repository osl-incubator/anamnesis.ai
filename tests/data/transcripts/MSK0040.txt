D: OK, and. Has there been anything that's made it worse?

P: Um just putting weight or like trying to bear any weight on that ankle has made it worse.

D: OK, and so I next wanted to move to the physical exam component and ask you to have a look at your ankles. And are you seeing any swelling or redness or discolouration?

P: So I there's a. Like there's a bruise about 4 centimeters wide and it appear swollen, but just by right ankle.

D: Just your right ankle, OK. And is there any temperature changes like warmth when you touch it?

P: Uh slightly warm yeah.

D: OK. And are you seeing any muscle atrophy or deformities of the of the ankle or foot.

P: No.

D: OK. Uhm and, uh if you press on areas of your of your ankle and foot, do you feel pain at the lateral malleolus or the medial malleolus?

P: Uh, there's a lot of pain on the lateral malleolus.

D: OK. Um and do you feel pain if you press on the top of your foot like a?

P: Um on the, no no pain at the top of my foot.

D: OK, and how about on the like outside or lateral aspect of your foot you'll feel a kind of, it's a bony prominence that that sticks out at the base of the 5th or you're kind of last metatarsals is there any pain there?

P: No, no pain there.

D: OK, and then how about any pains on that like medial side of your foot?

P: On the medial side, no.

D: OK, and then when it comes to moving the foot, are you able to point your toes on your foot up towards your face?

P: Up towards my face that's hard.

D: OK, so dorsiflexion is limited. And how about pushing your foot down like you're pressing on the gas pedal?

D: OK, so planter flexion is is painful as well. And then any issues with moving your toes?

P: No.

D: OK, and then you mentioned that with walking you're having a limp currently?

P: Yes.

D: OK, so we have an antalgic gates with an inability to bear weight as well. OK, so the that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today and based on these features it is starting like it could be either an ankle fracture or an ankle sprain. But because of the pin-point tenderness or that you're finding on the lateral side as well as some of the the inability to bear weight as you're describing it'll be important to get an X-Ray to make sure that there's not a fracture. Um and yeah, and if there is then it will be important to have some sort of air boot or casting so that to make sure that we're offloading the area for the bones to heal, but we'll see what the X-Ray shows.

P: OK, that sounds great, thank you. 

D: Thank you.
