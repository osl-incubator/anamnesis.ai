You, it sounds like um sounds like with the with the fuzzy feeling, the fevers, the difficulties breathing, I think it would be a good idea for you to stay here for a couple of days maybe, but we'll um we'll let you know what happens and what the results show. I'm really glad that you decided to come in today. Do you have any questions for me?

P: Um no, thank you so much.

D: Welcome. Um so the likely diagnosis is um a pneumonia, either bacterial or viral, but given yeah, yeah could be either, OK. 

P: Do I still need to isolate in this case?

D: Oh that's very true. Yep, Yep uh so.

P: OK. 

D: Well, you will be in the hospital, so yes you do. We will be we will be doing a Covid test, but that's a really good point um uh because your symptoms do overlap with Covid symptoms um we will also uh have you in an isolated room away from other patients until your Covid swabs are back and we know whether um, yeah, we'll follow the guidelines um put forth by the public health. 

P: OK, sure.
