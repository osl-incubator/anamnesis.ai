P: Oh, no. 

D: OK. How about ah, asthma or things like allergic rhinitis and allergies?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK. Uhm, so I I think that was all the questions that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that I maybe forgot to ask about or or that you wanted to mention?

P: Uh, no, that was kind of it. What should I do for him?

D: Uhm, so it's it sounds like the most likely diagnosis now is something called Croup or laryngeal tracheal bronchitis, which is basically a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract areas, and so it can cause had a barky cough and stridor and fever. And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well. But if he stays relatively stable, then it's mostly supportive care, just making sure he's hydrated as much as possible, you could use like humidified air. Sometimes like a hot shower. That sort of thing can maybe help relieve the cough at night.

P: OK. 

D: But umm, that's about it. 

P: OK.

D: We'll, so, we'll so we'll just observe for now.

P: OK, that sounds good. Thank you.
