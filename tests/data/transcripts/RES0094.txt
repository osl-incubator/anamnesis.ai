You've been a little bit drowsy, had some headaches in the past five days, things were getting a little bit worse early on, but it's been a little bit, it's been more stable now. We'll do a physical exam, see, just listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth and check your temperature and go from there. It sounds like you probably have a viral infection of some sort that should get, hopefully get better over time. We will also get a covid swab done just in case and if things seem to get worse, we can, you can definitely come back.

P: OK, great, thank you.
