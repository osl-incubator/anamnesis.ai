D: OK um and well, let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. Um so I'm going to get you to stand up from a sitting position. Does that hurt your back?

P: Um yeah it does. I I do feel a little bit of a a twinge there.

D: OK, and where about specifically?

P: Kind of just, yeah, on the lower uh lower right side like more on the, more on the right side.

D: More on the right side, OK. Now, if you have a mirror with you, or if you have someone there with you who can um speak to this, does your right side appear more red, swollen, or hot compared to your left side of the lower back?

P: Uh no, nothing like that. 

D: No, OK, and does it seem like it's more atrophied or do you see any deformities or skin changes in that area?

P: Uh nope, no deformities or skin changes. 

D: OK, um alright and I'm gonna get you to um bend down all the way and touch your toes if you can.

P: Um yeah I I can get part part way down.

D: You can get partway down, does it hurt?

P: Um a little bit, I can feel it pulling and stretching, yeah.

D: OK. Um alright, and then I'm gonna get you to uh like laterally flex to your right side. So kind of like you're doing an exercise um and you're just like bending towards that side.

P: Yeah, that hurts.

D: That hurts, OK, how about the other side, the left side?

P: Yeah that hurts too.

D: OK. Um and now I wanna get you to uh bring your knees up towards the ceiling. Does that hurt? One at a time, like your right right knee and your left knee.

P: Uh, not really.

D: No, OK, how about when you um flex your knees backwards?

P: Nope.

D: And kind of point your knees towards the ground.

P: No, no pain there.

D: OK, so no pain on knee extension or flexion. Um how about when you point your toes to the ceiling?

P: Uh no pain there.

D: OK so no pain on plantar flexion, how about when you point your uh toes to the ground?

P: No pain there.

D: OK, so no pain on dorsiflexion, and then sorry I forgot to ask you earlier, do you have any sort of numbness in the groin area?

P: No, no numbness in the groin area.

D: OK, so no numbness in the groin area, no weakness, no um changes in your bowel or bladder habits, including no incontinence, so uh no red flags?

P: Yeah, nothing like that.

D: OK, OK, good um and, OK so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?

P: Uh, no I was just uh yeah, kind of wondering do I do I need any X Rays or like what what what's going on?

D: Yeah, so um what it sounds like right now is that you have something called mechanical back pain. It's pretty common and um it can be anything from your spinal joints to the discs to the vertebrate or soft tissue or muscle. Um and a lot of these can be caused by um hard activity at work, um like carrying heavy things um and then carrying them in like an improper position or something like that. Um and we diagnose that on history and physical exam, um but if after we try some management and treatment plans, it doesn't go away and it persists for more than eight weeks, we do recommend imaging, including an MRI. So uh in terms of management for right now, um modified activity at work, um some short term bed rest, uh very short term though um and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms, um and you definitely shouldn't be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours, and physical activity can help, um so referral to physical therapy or physiotherapy um can help in rehab and they'll give you some exercises that you can try at home to kind of um strengthen those muscles. And then ice and heating packs um temporarily can help, uh medications like NSAIDs can help as well with the inflammation. Um so we'll try these things out and then we'll continue to follow up. Um yeah, did you have any questions or does that sound like an OK plan?

P: Uh that sounds like a good plan.

D: OK, sounds good, thank you.
