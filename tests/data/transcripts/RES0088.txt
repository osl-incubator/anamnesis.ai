P: No.

D: No OK, alright so I think that's all the questions I had right now. Do you have any questions or concerns?

P: No, no questions, but uhm, actually, what do you think she has and how can we treat her?

D: Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

P: Uh no, that sounds great, thank you.

D: You're welcome and yeah, we'll, just do a full examination and then go from there.

P: OK, sounds great thanks.

D: You're welcome.  Take care.

P: You too.
