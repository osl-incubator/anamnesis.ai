P: No, no.

D: OK. Was there anything going on two days ago around the time of the headache, like did you hit your head or anything like that?

P: No, I just, uhm, I just went out for dinner, the night before and I know that there are certain foods that can trigger my migraines, but this really feels different. It doesn't feel like my migraine.
