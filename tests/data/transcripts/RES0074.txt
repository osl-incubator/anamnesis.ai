P: Yeah, so I currently live with my wife and son. We live in a house just in London, and like, I made sure to just isolate myself to one room and I wear a mask around them just in case.

D: OK, well that's good. Yeah, it's important to be socially distancing, especially when having symptoms. Has anybody else in that house been sick?

P: No, no one has been sick recently, at least in my house, but uh, just two weeks ago I did attend a family event, and just last week I found out, uhm, someone was having symptoms. They just got tested two days ago and their test result hasn't come back. 

D: OK, I see. And have you traveled anywhere outside of the province or outside of the country? 

P: No, it was just here in London, so nothing other than that. I haven't left the province.

D: OK, and what was the approximate number of people?

P: It was just five peaople so we satyed within the limits stated for the city and they were people, in like, my circle as well, so yeah, I don't think I was doing anything wrong.

D: OK, nobody's had a heart attack or a stroke?

P: Uh, no.

D: Or any cancer in the family?

P: Oh yeah, cancer, uh, so my father has. It's not the bad skin cancer, it's the one where they can just zap it off.

D: OK, uh, and so, he hasn't needed surgery for it?

P: No?

D: OK, and I think that's all the questions that I wanted to ask today. Was there anything else that that maybe I forgot to tell you or forgot to ask about?

P: Yeah, I was just wondering, I don't know the results of the contact that I had, uh, so should I also get tested today?

D: Yeah, certainly with nonspecific symptoms such as what you've been experiencing, we will do a test for covid today. However, we will do some lab investigations as well, because it could be something else, so we'll wait for some of those results to come back, and it's great that you've already taken the initiative to isolate from family members and whatnot. And so I ask you to continue doing so, and we will get back to you when the results are in.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds good, thank you so much.
