D: I would just like to start with what brought you in here today to the family clinic?

P: Yeah, so I've been coughing for a few months now and so that's the problem.

D: OK, and how many months have you been coughing for?

P: Just over two, I would say, and it's been I've been bringing up this yellow, greenish sputum. It's kind of gross.

D: OK, and how, how much of the sputum would you say you're bringing up in an average day? Like a teaspoon? Tablespoon?

P: : Oh I see OK. I don't know, maybe a few teaspoons throughout the day.

D: OK.

P: At first I thought I I I had a, a chest infection, but even after antibiotics from my GP, or or my family doctor, It never cleared up. 

D: OK, and so when did you go on the antibiotics?

P: Ah so this is about, uh, about a month ago. 

D: Mhmm.

P: And yeah, so I went to see my family doctor about the cough then and dad was prescribed some antibiotics. I think azithromycin and it, it still didn't, it didn't do anything. 

D: OK, I see. And do you find that your cough has been getting worse since then?

P: Uh, I would say the cough has been about the same.

D: OK. But how about the sputum that you're bringing up, has that increased? 

P: Uh, it's about the same, but it definitely I would say there's a pink tinge in the sputum now. Every once in awhile I've noticed more than than before.

D: OK. And did this all start after the chest infection or did you have something like this occur before?

P: Um, yeah, this all started after.

D: OK, I see. Was there anything that happened around that time? Any new environment that you were exposed to?

P: Ah, well, I did go to India a few months ago.

D: OK, and how many months was that? Was that also like two months ago? 

P: Yeah, about that, probably closer to three or four, but yeah, right around the time that that I think this, uhm cough started or just before I got back.

D: OK, I see. And how often are you coughing in a day? 

P: Ah. a few times an hour.

D: OK. Anything that makes your cough go away now you've tried?

P: Uh, no nothings really helped it go away.

D: OK, and is it better or worse? During good morning as opposed to night?

P: Uh, it's pretty, it's pretty bad all day actually and it's been impacting my sleep because I've been coughing at night too.

D: I see. And, um, in terms of things that make it worse, anything you do around the house or at work that makes the coughing worse?

P: Uh yeah, I guess if I'm just moving around a little bit more it might bring it on a little bit more, but it's pretty bad all day.

D: I see. And in terms of any other symptoms you might be having, uh, do you have any shortness of breath, runny nose, any chest pain?
