D: Do you smoke?

P: No, I do not.

D: Do you use cannabis or any other substances?

P: No, I don't use anything like that.

D: OK, OK, well I think that just about covers the things that I wanted to ask you today so. Based on the symptoms you're experiencing. It sounds like it could be some kind of infective process, like maybe some kind of viral infection that we're concerned about, particularly this year. I'd really like to get a swab done on you. It's not necessarily covid, but it potentially could be. So what we're going to have to ask you to do is to self isolate you and your family for 14 days and hopefully will get the results back shortly and you'll know whether your COVID test is positive or not.

P: OK.

D: Does that sound like a good plan to you?

P: Yeah, that sounds good.

D: OK well thanks for chatting with me. We will get that swab done right away.

P: Thank you.
