D: No, nothing like that, OK. Alright, so yeah those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?

P: No.

D: OK. So yeah, so, we'll, we'll be doing a couple we'll do a physical examination, I want to see examined with the rash looks like and there's many things that can cause a rash. There's uh viral infections that can cause some of the symptoms. The symptoms he's having mainly seen viral with a dry cough and runny nose. And then you can we have a rash as well. One thing I forgot to ask actually is is he fully immunized?

P: Um, he I guess he didn't get all his immunizations done earlier. He did get them a little bit later so we came from Syria as refugees. But I I'm thinking he got all his immunizations when he, uh, came to, when we moved to Canada.

D: OK, and is he complaining of joint or muscle aches at all?

P: No.

D: No, nothing like that, OK. Alright, so yeah, we'll do it like a full physical examination, and if it's more just a viral, it'll be something that we'll just have to monitor and do supportive care for. But if it's anything else we might need to do further investigations. OK, and we'll just do a COVID swab for him today as well as some of the symptoms overlap with COVID symptoms and you will get the results back in 24 hours to 48 hours and then further instruction from public health.

P: Sounds great.

D: Alright, well, take care, talk to you soon.
