P: No, I was just I. wondering what might be going on. It's been a few days.

D: Yeah, for sure uhm so it sounds like you may have a viral infection, and because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a Covid swab on you just to rule that out. Uhm, but from the sounds of what your symptoms are, it, it is most likely to be a common cold, in which case you can just manage it with a lot of hydration, nutrition, good sleep. But if your symptoms get worse or they're not going away after a couple of weeks, or you're having neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, you should get help from the ER. Does that sound OK?

P: Yeah, for sure I haven't had any any symptoms like that, so so far, so that's good.

D: Yeah for sure. Alright, take care.

P: Take care, thank you.
