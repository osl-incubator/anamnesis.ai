P: No.

D: OK. Have you been sexually active before?

P: Uh, no. 

D: OK, so umm, OK. Uhm, so that was all the questions that, uhm that, that I wanted to ask, was there anything else that you wanted to umm, mention today?

P: Uh no, I don't think so. Is it, when you asked me if my neck was swollen, my necks not swollen but I feel like inside the back of my throat, my tonsils feel a little bit swollen.

D: OK. And have you looked? Does it look like you have like redness in the back of your, back of your mouth?

P: Yeah, it looks pretty red and angry.

D: OK, and it's sore?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so it's just to kind of summarize, this happens like this sometimes you been having so the sore throat, like the redness and swelling of the tonsils in the back of your mouth, as well as a fever and being pretty tired over these last few days.

P: Yes.

D: OK, yeah. Um alright, so it's sounding like most likely this would be strep throat or, or Group A strep pharyngitis with, because you have no cough, and with a high fever and swelling that you've been redness that you notice in the back of your mouth. And so we'll do a rapid strep antigen test and it will require just a throat swab. To see, to to detect for that, however with a, uh, umm, yeah, I guess that's it. That's what I yeah, well, we'll start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm, a viral illness, but that's lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now. And because of COVID it will be, we'll do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with COVID as well. 

P: Ok.

D: So just to make sure that we're being comprehensive.

P: OK. That sounds good. Thank you so much. 

D: Thank you.
