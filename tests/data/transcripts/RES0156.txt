D: OK. Um any medications that she has been on at all?

P: So when that happens we just use um like she'll just take a uh like Reactine or like I don't know something like that, but just an allergy pill, um but it's yeah, that's it.

D: OK. Um OK, and does anyone smoke in the household?

P: Um no, they don't.

D: OK. Um OK, so those were all the questions I had. Um do you have any questions?

P: Uh, no, I just uh yeah just wanted to figure out what's going on with this cough.

D: OK, yeah, so it seems like the symptoms have been going on for a few months now. It seems that she gets them on exertion and um they're worsened by exertion. Um at this age, one thing that definitely we want to check is if she has asthma. Um she does have some other symptoms that um are associated with asthma, like it seems that she gets um, some irritation through environmental factors as well. So what we'll do uh for her is get something called a pulmonary function test for her to see, that'll test if she in fact has asthma or not, and then based on that we will uh see if she needs any puffers. Um that can help relieve some of her symptoms. Uh and lastly, since she's having a cough, we'll also do a like a Covid test just in case as well.

P: OK, yeah that that sounds good. Thank you.

D: Yeah, and no worries, and then we'll also do like a full physical examination.

P: That sounds great.

D: Alright.
