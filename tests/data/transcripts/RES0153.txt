D: OK, yeah, so um it's possible, so based on your symptoms currently it does suggest that uh it it is a bacterial cause with uh, since you don't have a cough and you have um like it sounds like sounds like lymph node enlargement. Um we'll we'll look and see if there's exudates or or purulence on your um, that we can see in your in your throat as well as checking temperature and do a rapid strep test. Um see if um if that's the cause, and if so, um then yeah, there will be a course of antibiotics um will be required, but um we will uh wait for um the physical exam and then the uh the rapid test.

P: Alright, sounds good.
