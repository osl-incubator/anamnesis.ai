P: Yeah, let my nose so stuffy and sometimes it's just like my eyes and my nose are just itchy and my eyes get like red and teary sometimes. It's so embarrassing when I'm going to school.

D: Well, it's really great that you're, you know, trying to lose weight and dieting and and having like a healthier lifestyle. It is definitely harder with the pandemic going on right now to to get in the activities. And it's hard like being at home, and sometimes it's really difficult to like not eat right

P: Yeah yeah true.

D: So besides besides that any kind of recent exposures to any fumes, dust, animals, pets like anything like that?

P: Yeah, it was kind of like vacuuming a couple of days ago when it got really bad, but nothing. Not not. I don't think there's not been any other exposures.

D: OK. And do you have any past medical conditions that you have been diagnosed with like asthma, eczema, anything like that?

P: I haven't been diagnosed with anything. No. I did have like I know that I would sometimes get kind of short of breath as a child. But my mom doesn't really trust doctors, so she wouldn't take me to one.

D: OK, have you had shortness of breath after that, like when like as a child, how old were you?

P: I must have been like 8 years old or 9 years old that I remember, but I think I've had it before that as well as my mom tells me.

D: Oh OK, do you have that at all now?

P: No, no, I don't.

D: OK, OK Have you ever seen an allergist before?

P: No, no.

D: No OK. Do you have any known allergies to any medications? Yeah any medication? 

P: no 

D: no. Do you take any medications at all on a regular basis?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past?

P: No.

D: Any family history of any asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis. Anything like that? 

P: Yeah, I think it kind of runs in my family like everyone in my family is just kind of always having this runny nose and sneezing. My mom has it. My younger brother has it. But like we haven't really been diagnosed with anything like we, we rarely go to the doctor.

D: OK, OK, and currently right now, do you work at all? Or sorry, do you go to school?

P: I do I do. I've been doing it virtually.

D: Virtually OK, so have you noticed anyone sick around you?

P: No. 

D: No OK. And what at home? What's your living situation like? Who do you live with?

P: I live with my mom, dad and my younger brother.

D: And, yeah, I just want to let you know that any questions I ask you today and anything we talked about it's completely confidential and unless like there is any potential harm to yourself or anyone anyone else. So yeah, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Do you feel safe at home? 

P: Oh yeah.

D: OK, and do you drink alcohol at all? Or have you tried alcohol?

P: No, not at all. 

D: Have you tried any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No. No. 

D: How about smoking?

P: Umm no 

D: no OK, and are you sexually active?

P: No. 

D: No OK. And so overall, do you feel safe in your home and as well as outside of your home environment? Any kind of bullying or anything like that going on? 

P: No, not at all. 

D: OK, alright. Yeah, so those are kind of all the questions that I had for you. Sorry just one more question, any loss of sense of taste or smell?

P: Yeah, it's hard to smell and my nose is stuffy, but no loss of taste.

D: Yeah, OK. OK, so do you have any questions at all for me?

P: No, I just I I just wanna get some medications to help with this. I'm just sick and tired of my runny nose.

D: Yeah, it must be very frustrating. So you've tried Reactin before, right? 

P: yeah

D: Yeah, so one method is to definitely like stay away from some of those allergens that are potentially causing your symptoms. But I I do really think so you might have something called like allergic rhinitis. And I think it might be beneficial to for you to see like an allergist

P: sure.

D: And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require. In the meantime, definitely like any antihistamine medications would help with your symptoms. But since you're also having congestion and sneezing, just just in case, we will just do a COVID swab test for you today. And it takes around 24 to 48 hours to come back. And in the meantime, you should just isolate as much as you can in your own home. And then based on the result they would give you more instruction.

P: Sure

D: Alright. Thank you, take care.
