D: Oh, I see. Yeah, it might definitely that's that might be concerning if you know well, we'll get that check though on X Ray and everything, but we just need to do a few few more questions and some examination as well. How would you describe your living situation right now?

P: Oh so. I'm living on on my own actually in an apartment.

D: OK. Alright, uh, a couple of bottles a week, so how much would you have in an average day?

P: I'll probably I guess, probably like two or three glasses of wine a day.

D: OK. Yeah, so we definitely recommend for women. Uh to limit themselves to an maybe one to two, max 2 glasses of wine a day as it can have health effects in the future in terms of drinking and on your liver. OK, and other than that I just had a few questions. Do any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: No, stayed away from that as well.

D: OK, OK, so I'm just going to ask you questions about specifically to examine your wrist so you notice. So can you. Are you able to move your wrist around? Are you able to make a fist?

P: I I can but it I can't really bad my thumb and it it it hurts a lot. So I can bend my fingers but my thumb is kinda out.

D: OK, due to the joints in your thumb hurt at all. 

P: Um no.

D: OK. An any pain anywhere else like on your fingers or your elbow?

P: No. 

D: OK, and. What movement would you say hurts the most?

P: I I. Probably just moving the the wrist like flexing and extending the wrist

D: OK and where the swelling you said is at the base of the thumb, right?

P: Yeah, exactly at the base of the thumb on the on the back of the hand there are some bad bruising and swelling there.

D: OK is it warm at all to touch?

P: No, it doesn't feel warm.

D: OK, OK, and if you press on are you getting any bony pain in that area, like if you press on a bone?

P: Yeah, like, I mean, if I there's one spot that if I press down on it, it's like 10 of the 10 pain. It hurts really bad if I press at the base of my thumb there.

D:  OK, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We definitely need to, since you're having pain on, just tell palpate palpating the area, there swelling redness, and you did have a fall and you landed on your you caught yourself with your hand. There is a common fracture that can happen in those circumstances to your wrist. And so we need to do an X-Ray and we will see if you have a fracture or not. But we also need to see if we need to get a cast for you or if if we can manage your injury with a splint or. And then based on what we see and if your physical examination we will determine how long you need to be in a cast or splint, and then we'll go from there.

P: OK, that sounds good, thank you.
