D: OK, and do you drink alcohol?

P: Well I'll have one or two beers on the weekend.

D: OK. Alright, so yeah, that's pretty much all the questions I had right now. It seems that your symptoms, You do have that cough and the shortness of breath and it's been chronic, but now you're coughing up some blood as well, so that is definitely something that's concerning and we want to make sure there is nothing going on so we will get a chest X-ray for you and see if we can find anything there. Are still producing the bloody sputum?

P: Yeah, that's been coming up a daily still.

D: OK, so if you think you can produce that, we can even take a sample of that as well and see if there is any presence. The one thing that we are concerned about with some of your symptoms and a long history of smoking as well is lung cancer. So yeah, we will do a chest X-ray, get some cytology done as well and then once we have that in the future we may need to maybe do a biopsy but right now we'll do a few of the first things that I mentioned and then go from there.

P: That sounds good. Thank you.

D: You're welcome. Take care.

P: Bye.
