D: What brings you in?

P: Hi Faiha, I've been very concerned lately. This past week I, first just started having this really bad headache and then my body, just completely all started hurting after completely rest, and then three days ago I just started having a lot of chills and I had a pretty high fever, just two days ago of almost like I think it was like 38 or 39, yeah, I was just very concerned and I came here today.

D: Yeah, it's good that you came in. Lets rewind a little bit and get a full history. So you said the, what started first, the fever or the headache?

P: So, the headache started first, so that was around four days ago.

D: OK

P: And three days ago, like my body just started aching all over the place and then just two days ago I noticed that I had a fever and I've been getting a fever since then, as well, like even today, I was having chills.

D: OK, OK, and you said your highest recorded temperature was 39?

P: Like 38 to 39.

D: OK, so headache started four days ago. Is it persistent or constant or does it come and go?

P: It was pretty constant, the headache kind of got better yesterday but last few days it's just been constant headache Pretty much every day.

D: OK, OK. Does anything make it better or worse?

P: Just some rest and, uh, I tried to take some Tylenol to get rid of it, took some Advil as well. It did help a little bit, but it just kind of came back after the medication wore out.

D: How long does the headache last when you get it?

P: If I don't take medications, it can last honestly, the whole day.

D: OK, yeah, um, and if you were to describe it, is it sharp, dull, achy?

P: It's just achy and it's kind of all over the front of my forehead.

D: OK.

P: Sometimes it's just like a throbbing pain.

D: OK, and, alright, and you said it's mostly at the front of your head. How about near the Crown of your head, temples?

P: It can go to the temples sometimes, but mostly it's my forehead.

D: OK, OK, and severity-wise 1 to 10, 10 being the worst headache you've ever, worst pain you've ever felt. How bad is it?

P: Right now it's not that bad, probably like a two or three, but when it was, just a few days ago, it was like probably an 8 or 9.

D: No, and have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?

P: Not that I know of.

D: Do you still go to work?

P: I just have like a desk job. I have my own room. It's not like, I don't see too many people and like, when I do I'm wearing a mask so I don't think so.

D: OK.

P: I have stopped going to work though like, just in case.

D: OK, good and have you traveled to anywhere recently?

P: No, we've been pretty homebound.

D: Pretty homebound, OK, alright, well that's good and those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?

P: Yeah, I don't know, what do you think is causing all of this?

D: Yeah, it sounds like you have some sort of infection, so the first thing we need to rule out is covid, of course. So we'll do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then, it's important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least, and that includes from other people at home. And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out. And, so that's where we'll start for now, because your presentation is acute, we think it's likely infection related.

P: OK, that sounds good to me and should I be staying in my own room or anything like that at home?

D: Yeah, if you can like, it's recommended that you try to isolate in your own room for the next 14 days because your symptoms do overlap with that of covid, yeah.

P: OK, sounds good.Thank you.

D: Yeah, no worries, take care.

P: Thank you.
