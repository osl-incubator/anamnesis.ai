D: I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in?

P: Sure, you know I've been feeling kinda hot for the past couple of days and I have this terrible, terrible headache. And just my brain feels foggy. So I thought I should come get it checked out.

D: OK, we'll be sure to check that today in clinic. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms?

P: Um, just like the brain fog that I was speaking of, you know. I just don't remember, I remember things, but it's it's like I'm doing everything underwater.

D: Alright. And do you smoke cigarettes? 

P: I don't.

D: OK. Do you smoke marijuana? 

P: I don't.

D: Alright. Did you use any recreational drugs?

P: I sometimes take some marijuana edibles, but that's about it.

D: OK, and, do you purchase those at a dispensary?

P: I do.

D: OK, so for one of the Ontario stores?

P: Yes. 

D: OK great yeah 'cause you could never be sure where else, what the dosing is, so it's good to get it from the appropriate stores for sure.

P: Right.

D: Do you drink alcohol?

P: I do, I'll have a glass of wine with dinner.

D: OK is this daily?

P: Um most days I would say, maybe like four or five days of the seven days of the week.

D: OK, I see. And has anybody in your family had similar symptoms in the past to what you're having or had any lung conditions in the past?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, how about any heart conditions?

P: Um, my father passed away at 75 from a heart attack.

D: OK, and uh, how about any cancers in the family?

P: None that I know of.

D: OK. So I think that was, uh, all of the questions that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that you thought I was missing or that you wanted to tell me about?

P: No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?

D: So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?

P: OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up.

D: Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.

P: OK, alright that sounds good, thank you.
