P: That there is a carpet and in the basement that, he uses that as his playroom, sometimes 

D: OK. OK. Yeah, so those are all the questions I had. Do you have any questions at all?

P: Yeah, I was just wondering like if this could be maybe asthma as well?

D: Yeah, so definitely. That's something that's at the top of our head right now, especially due to his age and the symptoms that he's been having after exertion in particular. And the family history of asthma as well. So definitely that's something that we want to investigate. So what we'll do for him is first, we'll do like a full physical examination. Listen to his alongs. And just assess his breathing and then afterwards we will order some tests for him, so he's six years old, right?

P: He is yes.


D: OK, so we'll see if we can do something called a pulmonary function test. Sometimes it depends on the child 
if they're able to follow instructions, and so that test requires a completely breathing out and following some instructions during the test. So since he's six, he might be able to do that. We we can try that. And then afterwards we'll see if he requires anything like an allergy testing or we will we might need to help manage his symptoms with a puffer, for example, like Ventilin and an  inhaled Cortico steroid, but those are just some discussions will have in the near future after we've done all these investigations.

P: OK, great, thank you.

D: You're welcome alright, take care 

P: Bye.
