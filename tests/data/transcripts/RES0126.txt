P: Two months of difficulty breathing and the cough is gotten worse. I've had a cough for a couple years now. I'm a smoker.

D: OK and is is this cough different at all?

P: It's just, it just doesn't go away.

P: About two months ago.

P: Shortness of breath just kind of stays.

D: OK, and is there anything that helps with your shortness of breath, like taking a rest or any positions in particular?

D: OK, and is it worse at all when you lay down?

P: No. 

D: No? And do you find yourself ever having to wake up at night and gasp gasping for air?

P: No, it hasn't gotten that far but seeing how bad it's been over the past two months and how fast is progressing, I won't be surprised if I can't even sleep. It's been quite difficult I I don't even know why I waited so long. I should have come in earlier.

D: Well, I'm glad you came in today. We can definitely try and help you with what's going on. Do you at all use any kind of medications to help you with your symptoms?

P: Yeah, yeah I do. That's the one that I've been trying to use but 

D: Has it been less effective at all recently?

P: I smoke, I smoke a pack a day

D: OK. Have you at all tried to quit before? 

P: I can't quit. It's not gonna happen. A lot of people have told me try to quit but I I just can't live without it and I'm 75 now, you know. Like I'm not gonna live a lot longer anyway.

D: Yeah yeah but also even if you try to cut down some of your symptoms might get better. Like even though you're 75, you can definitely have improvement in some of your symptoms that you're having, like the shortness of breath and coughing. So if at all that you you want to consider cutting down and gradually. we can talk about that more as well. 

P: Sure

D: OK, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana? 

P: No

D: Do you drink?

P: No 

D: No, OK, so yeah, those are all the questions I have for you. Do you have any questions for me? 

P: No, I just I guess I need to be admitted right? Just like those other COPD exacerbations? I'm thinking this is exactly that and I'll have to stay in the hospital, right? for a couple of days

D: Yeah, so we definitely before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted, since you said the Ventolin is not working for you, we will definitely give you some some ventilation and perhaps steroid for just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now, and we want to also make sure since you're having like cough as well as shortness of breath to do a covid swab on you, just in case. I know you've been like isolating and everything, but just in case I will do that and we'll get like a chest x ray on you as well, just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on. And then from there we'll also get your blood work, and then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission.

P: Sure. 

D: OK, and there you might, I'm not 100% sure, but you might require home oxygen if like we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low. Have you have you been talked about that at all in the past?

P: Yeah, they talked about it last time I've been trying to avoid it, but if it has to happen, it has to happen.

D: Hmm yeah, and it might just sometimes just, you know you've had four admissions in the past and it might actually just help you stay at home if you are on oxygen. Anyways, yeah we can talk about that. We'll do like a full physical examination everything and go from there.

P: Sure. 

D: Great, I'll be with you shortly.
