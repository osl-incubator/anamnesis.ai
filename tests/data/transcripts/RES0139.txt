P: No, nothing else.

D: Yeah, so we can definitely talk more about alcohol usage definitely, especially when there's uh, people going through stressful times. There can be increasing substance use, including alcohol, so we definitely have a lot of resources that we can um, discuss today if you would like.

P: Yeah, I would really like that. Thank you. 

D: You're welcome. Um yeah, but those are all the questions I had for today. We'll definitely do like a physical examination, but it seems you've just been having a cough for the last two weeks. 

P: Yeah.

D: Without any other symptoms. Um, okay, so do you have any questions at all for me?

P: Um no.

D: So what we'll do is, since you've had this cough for the last two weeks, we definitely want to do a COVID swab, just in case. You've been uh, working from home, but if there was any potential contact, they usually, it comes back in 24 to 48 hours.

P: Okay.

D: Other than that, sometimes uh, with a history of smoking, you can have something called uh, COPD. We can, like after the physical examinations and everything, we can potentially discuss doing pulmonary function tests as well. Um, and yeah, but other than that, it can also just be like a dry cough, can be just a viral upper respiratory tract infection that takes two or more weeks to resolve. In that case we wouldn't really.

P: Sure. 

D: Um, yeah, so we'll do the physical examination and then go from there. 

P: Sounds great. 

D: Alright, take care.
