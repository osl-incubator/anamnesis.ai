D: OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Do you have any questions?

P: No, that was, uh, about it I was uh I was wondering if you think I I have an infection or is this uh COPD acting up, or what's going on?

D: Yeah, so definitely with your history of COPD and um these symptoms, it can just be an exacerbation of your COPD and that can happen sometimes when you have COPD and then you get a either viral or bacterial infection and that makes your symptoms worse, and you've also had a fever, so we'll do like a full physical examination, get your vitals, everything, but uh and then we'll give you some uh like nebulized like um for your home puffers too, but all just in the hospital and monitor your response to them. Uh and then we'll also get like your, some of your blood work and chest X-ray just to see if there's any like pneumonia. And lastly we'll just get like a Covid swab done since some of these symptoms also overlap with Covid symptoms. Um and yeah so we'll, so that's what we'll do um and I'll let the emergency department know that you're on your way. I think you'll need to get all those tests there, and then they'll decide whether or not you need any kind of admission or you can just go home on antibiotics um from there, OK?

P: OK, that sounds good. Thank you.

D: Yeah yeah alright take care.

P: Bye.
