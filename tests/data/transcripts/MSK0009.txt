D: It could be, a stroke could have had many different type of types of causes for it, and one of them could be 'cause caused by blood clot. But I wouldn't be able to say for sure.

P: OK.

D: Just because, yeah, there are so many different types or reasons for for having a stroke .

P: I see OK.

D: So yeah, so you mentioned your leg has some swelling, um do you feel as though there's any any like temperature change to your calf like is it hot?

P: Uhm, I think I I don't know if it's maybe a little bit warm, but definitely swollen.

D: OK, and do you feel, is there any pain to palpation? Like if you touch your calf or something like that is there pain?

P: Yeah if I touch my right calf it's painful and then if I press down on it's really painful and then just on the outside of my right knee if I touch or press down it really hurts as well. 

D: OK. And if you move your foot so it yeah, if you dorsiflex your ankle. Or bending your your toe up towards your nose, do you end up getting any calf pain? Doing the Homan test.

P: Yeah, yeah I'll try that. And yeah, I think it definitely hurts. When I when I move my or point my toes towards my nose.

D: OK. OK, so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that that maybe I missed?

P: No, I think that's all. 

D: OK yeah alright so with the. I fall 2 days ago. Things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from from the fall which could have pain when you touch it, there could be some swelling and said it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be like injuries to some of that, the ligaments there as well. And however, with this the swelling immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive that with swelling and a positive Homan in test and your temperature is a little bit elevated today not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis and so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies, get an ultrasound of your right calf as well as an X Ray of the right knee to to start OK.

P: OK sounds good. Thank you so much.
