P: No, no cancers. 

D: I see, alright. Did you have any other questions for me today? I think that was everything I wanted to ask about for now. 

P: Ah no, what do you like, what do you think I have, and how do you think I should treat it?

D: So, uh, yeah, it's sounding like, like it could be tuberculosis based on the kind of timeline of your symptoms and so and cough and hemoptysis and so we'll do a test for that, like an acid fast test of the sputum. Get a chest X Ray. And if it is tuberculosis, it will require a prolonged course of antibiotics, so that I'll be over several months. Umm, and so I we'll get the infectious disease team involved to help kind of guide our management with the appropriate antibiotic choice, if it does come back to be tuberculosis.

P: OK. OK, that sounds good, thank you.
