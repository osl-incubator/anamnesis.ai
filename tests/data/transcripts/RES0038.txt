D: So what brings you here today at the family clinic?

P: I haven't been coughing these last two weeks since I got back from Mexico. I think I got sick there.

D: OK, so just the last couple weeks you've been coughing?

P: Yeah, ever since I got back from Mexico it's been yeah so about about two weeks.

D: OK. And is your cough for a wet cough or dry cough?

P: It's dry and I'm not bringing up any any sputum.

D: OK, and are you coughing up any blood at all?

P: No blood.

D: No, OK. And is the cough constant or does it come and go?

P: It, it comes and goes. I would say sometimes it can be worse. Yeah, depending on on what I'm what I'm doing. I guess if I'm exercising or if it's if it's really cold outside, it might get worse. 

D: OK. And do you feel that it's been getting worse at all, your cough? 

P: Uh, not really, I think it's about the same.

D: OK, and anything that you did when you were in Mexico that might you think might have caused your cough?

P: Uh, I don't know, maybe I, I was drinking a little bit too much and partying a little bit too much so might have got sick while I was there.

D: I see. Did you have any cold symptoms like runny nose, sore throat? Um, any anything like that when you were there or after you came back?

P: No, sometimes my eyes can get a little itchy, but no runny nose or sore throat.

D: OK, have you had any previous episodes that are similar to how you're feeling now?

D: OK, and how often are you coughing? Let's say in an average day?

P: Um, it's uh, it's pretty variable. I would say, so if I'm exercising it will it'll throw me into a coughing fit and and sometimes it's really bugging me at night too it'll affect me. It's impairing my sleep.

D: OK, and so exercise makes it worse. Anything that you do that helps you relieve the cough?

P: Uhm, I actually I tried my sons inhaler and it seemed to actually help, but one of the days I just couldn't seem to stop the cough and I wanted to sleep so I gave it a try and it it seemed to actually help with the cough.

D: OK. Alright, so yeah those are all the questions I had for you today. Um, do you have any other questions for me?

P: Uhm, nope, that was it.

D: OK, so based on what we talked about, it seems that based on your past history and the coughing that you're having right now, one of the things that we definitely want to look at is if you do in fact have asthma. Um, it can also be like viral upper respiratory tract infection, but we will do some pulmonary function tests for you and see if the bronchodilators just like you use the inhaler from your son if that helps helps you with your symptoms and then we can go from there.

P: That sounds great. Thank you.

D: You're welcome. Well, take care.
