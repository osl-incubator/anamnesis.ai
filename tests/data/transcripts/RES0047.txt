P: Yeah, a few beers on the weekend. 

D: OK. Um and then where do you live currently?

P: I live in an apartment by myself. 

D: OK. Um and any reasons to think that there are any old carpets, mold, or um asbestos or anything like that that could be exacerbating your symptoms?

P: Uh I mean I do have a carpet in the bedroom so, but I mean that that's the only carpet in the apartment. 

D: OK. Um and do you live with anyone?

P: No, it's it's just me and my dog.

D: OK. Uh have you, have you been around any sick contacts recently? 

P: Um maybe, I mean I I usually will see uh, a couple of friends, we'll meet up to grab some coffee
in the morning in the morning um but I feel like they have been uh OK.

D: Yeah OK, how about um travel, have you traveled anywhere recently? 

P: No.

D: No, OK. OK, well I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss? 

P: Um no, I just wanted to, um, yeah, come in because it's been really difficult to breathe.

D: Yeah, so OK, well we'll do a physical exam on you um to try to understand um how bad your COPD exacerbation is. Um we'll also try to get an um oxygen saturation on you, and we do want that reading
to be between 88 to 92%. If it is less than that um and we think you have a mild exacerbation, we'll just suggest that you use your short acting beta agonist puffer um more often, and then if you,
if we think you have moderate, um moderate exacerbation we'll also prescribe uh antibiotics and or steroids to go along with the short acting beta agonist. And if it is severe, or if it becomes severe, um please do seek out aid um in the ER and they'll try, they'll probably put you on um uh some sort of, um oxy like um some sort of supplemental oxygen, whether it's BiPAP or CPAP. Um and again they'll continue giving you your bronchodilators and steroids, as well as antibiotics to um make sure that you don't have any bad complications of uh pneumonia. Um and it does sound like it is a COPD exacerbation at this point, but if you develop any other symptoms like um fevers, or any symptoms that overlap with uh viral viral illnesses, we'll we'll we'll work you up for that, we'll do, I think we will still do a covid swab on you just to make sure you don't have that, uh but we'll start with um working you up for COPD. How does that sound? 

P: That sounds great. Thank you.

D: Alright. Take care.
