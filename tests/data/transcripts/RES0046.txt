D: OK, no problem, So we'll, what we'll do is we'll get a covid swab on you just because your symptoms do overlap with those of covid, um so we want to make sure that that's not what you have, so we'll take a swab. You will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um but in the meantime, you still should isolate for 14 days, and that includes trying to isolate from your family members as well when, when possible, and uh public health will be in touch to let you know uh to do some contact tracing. If it's not covid, you you could possibly have um some sort of other viral infection that's going around these days. Um how does that sound? 

P: Yeah, it sounds great. Thank you. 

D: Alright, no worries.
