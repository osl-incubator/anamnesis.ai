D: I see OK. Has he been around anybody who's been sick that you're aware of, like at work or anything?

P: He works at this IT company. There aren't a lot of them and they all have their own cubicles, so you know, maybe in the lunch room or something, but other than that, I don't think so.

D: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know what happened?

P: Um, you know, I'm not too sure she doesn't always eat the healthiest, and she doesn't do a lot of exercise. So I think maybe that had something to do with it.

D: OK, um and did your parents have any heart problems?

P: No, they were both healthy and they passed away a few years ago, but they died of old age, I guess you can say.

D: OK. Any cancers in the family?

P: No.

D: Alright so I think that's all I wanted to cover on the history today. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me I maybe didn't ask?

P: Um no, I was just curious if you think I had COVID?

D: Certainly one of the top things that I'm considering after hearing about your symptoms of having this cough and fever and being tired these last few days, especially with your husband being sick with nausea, vomiting, and not feeling well. That being said, it could be another type of viral illness, or possibly a bacterial infection. But certainly we will order some investigations, some blood work, a PCR nasal swab that will actually test for COVID as well as a chest X Ray to start with. Um and we will wait for some of those results to come back.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds good.

D: Alright, so we'll get that started.

P: OK, thank you.
