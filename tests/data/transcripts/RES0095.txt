D: OK, do you know, uh, by any chance, what the, uh, last ejection fraction was on your echocardiogram?

P: I don't know, I, I don't know all of that. I don't know, you have to ask my daughter, she knows much more about me.

D: Yeah, no problem, well, we could look into, uh, some of those old, uh, older tests that you've done. OK, and, uhm, so can you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently? You mentioned your, your daughter, are you living with your daughter?

P: Yeah, I live with my daughter. My husband passed away, uh, three years ago, and so I've just been staying with my daughter. It's just the two of us now.

D: I see, I'm sorry to hear that about your husband. Uhm, are you currently, uh, like functioning independently around the home, or does your daughter help with a lot of the tasks?

P: Oh, she, she, she has to help me out, uhm she has to help me out. I uhm, I sometimes need help with the showering, simply because I get really short of breath and then, so I have to stop and it's just, she's just worried that it's unsafe, so she helps me out with that. Uhm, she gets most of the things done at home. She does the groceries and everything.

D: OK, I see, and do you, do you smoke cigarettes? 

P: I, I don't.

D: And, do you drink alcohol?

P: Not anymore.

D: OK, do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products?

P: No, no, no, no, nothing like that.

D: Alright, then, uh, do you, uhm, use any other recreational drugs?

P: No, no I don't.

D: Alright, uhm, have you been around anybody who you think might have been sick?

P: No, I've just been staying at home. My daughter's been working from home too.

D: OK, so uh, you haven't had much contact with, uhm.

P: No.

D: With others recently? OK, have you, so you haven't traveled anywhere?

P: No.

D: Alright, uh, and uh, and in terms of family history, has anybody had any heart or lung conditions?

P: Oh yeah, everyone in my family has high blood pressure. My mom had a heart attack. My brother had a heart attack. My sister had a heart attack. Everyone, everyone has heart problems.

D: OK, certainly sounds like something, uh, common in the family. Has there been any other, uh, conditions that run in the family? 

P: No. 

D: Alright, uhm, I, I don't, I don't think I asked. Have you had any fevers or chills?

P: No.

D: OK and or, or any night sweats?

P: No

D: OK, and, uh, I might have asked, but just to, to be complete, did you have any nausea or vomiting?

P: No. 

D: OK, uhm, so were there any other symptoms or anything else that, that I may have forgot to ask about?

P: No, I don't think so. It's just the, the difficulties with breathing and the swelling.

D: Yeah, so the first thing, I'll speak to your daughter and we will, uhm, get a look at some of the old or some of the reports from, uhm, over the last several months from, and from the cardiologist you see. But it's, uh, and then, uh, also we'll get some blood work and a chest x-ray. But it is sounding like this could be a heart failure exacerbation. Which, so some of the shortness of breath, it could be coming from fluid, uhm, that has accumulated in your lungs and so, uh, we'll give you, oh, another type of water pill now, Furosemide, to try and help get rid of some of that fluid so it will help with the breathing. And in the meantime, we'll wait for the investigations to come back. 

P: Sure, Thank you.
