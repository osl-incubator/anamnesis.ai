D: OK. Yeah, so those are some of the questions I had a, I will be doing a physical examination with your shortness of breath. I just want to get a good listen to your lungs and take all your vitals as well. However, yeah so after that since you're having some symptoms of what might be a pneumonia, it can be a bacterial infection, a viral infection, we will have to get some blood work done as well as a chest x-ray. And right now, with the pandemic going on, we will also do Covid swab test for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?

P: Yeah, that makes sense, thank you.

D: Alright and, if if you're while you're here, if your shortness of breath gets any worse at all, just let us know and we'll help you out.

P: OK, thank you, will do.

P: Bye.
