D: Yeah, certainly, um, feeling short of breath like that can be quite scary for sure. When, when do these episodes kind of happen? Are they spontaneous? Or can you think of things that you're doing when they when they come on.

P: Uhm? I, I don't know, it's just like. Uhm? Sometimes, like before interviews, sometimes just kind of random. Uhm, yeah. I can kind of tell when they're about to come on. Uhm? Yeah, I think. It's mostly like job interviews.

P: Job interviews? 

D: Yeah. 

P: I got I got laid off because of the pandemic and now I've been looking for jobs and it's just like it's kind of nerve wracking. But also like I don't know, I'm just worried it could be something else like it's just, yeah, it's like I really just can't breathe, it's so weird.

D: OK, yeah, it's certainly. It sounds like there's been a lot of stress recently. Certainly plenty for with the pandemic as well. And so when you get short of breath, you you said you have this, you could feel that it's coming on and how long does it last for?

P: Like 15 minutes 15, 20 minutes.

D: OK. And have you had panic attacks before?

P: No, but do you think that's what's going on?

D: Potentially, it certainly can't rule out. Inorganic cause meaning something going on, otherwise just yet we might need to do some physical exam and some investigations first, but it certainly could be related to that. With all of the stressors that are going on. And so you had a low mood. Have you had any periods in your life where you felt really energetic, like you didn't need any sleep, you're really talkative, you had all the energy in the world.

P: No.

D: OK, are you on any medications right now?

P: No, I was doing pretty well. I used to have these episodes of depression when I was younger as a teenager and they kind of went away. I was on meds at that time, but I think I think it's coming back now.

D: OK, so you haven't been on medication now for for quite awhile for years.

P: For like 12 years 13 years.

P: My mom has uh depression too.

D: OK. Anybody in in the family have problems with substance, substance use?

P: no.

D: OK. Um, and  I think that's everything that I I wanted to ask on history today. So you been having these episodes where you get really short of breath and you get chest pain, you'll get sweaty and have what sounds like what sounds like an impending sense of doom where you kind of feel like it's coming on and it lasts for 15 minutes and not related to exercise. Were there any other symptoms or things that you've been experiencing recently?

P: Yeah, it's also,  I also feel like my heart's like breathing really fast.

D: Oh, OK. And I does that, how long does it last for?

P: Same time. Like everything is just sort of comes on at the same time. Just kind of goes away together.

D: OK, would you say that it comes on like kind of like at the snap of your fingers sort of thing like really quickly and then?

P: I can kind of tell it's gonna come on like I have a sense of it and then it just like starts. It suddenly just happens.

D: OK. So you you have the heart racing, are there any other symptoms as well?

P: I don't think so.

D: OK, so, uh, we will get an ECG and  I will look at that, but I've been concerned now thinking that this might be related to anxiety or panic attacks and so, I guess that would be something that we could discuss more about in regards to like I guess previous traumas and things that and the stresses that you might be dealing with currently to help manage manage stress better.

P: Sure, thank you.
