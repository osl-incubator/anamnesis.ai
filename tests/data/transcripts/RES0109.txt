P: No, I haven't traveled anywhere.

D: No, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?

P: No. 

D: No, OK. So we'll do a covid swab anyways today because your, some of your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. But in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days.

P: Sure.

D: Um but it I think it does really sound like you have a common cold um so just like another viral illness, um so just treat it supportively you know um keep yourself hydrated, if you feel like you're getting a fever, take like Tylenol. Um if you have like pain like a headache or like sinus pressure or something you can take again an Advil or Tylenol. Um And if your symptoms worsen, or if you have any neurological symptoms, then you should see the ER um right away.

P: Sure.

D: Yeah, OK sounds good.

P: Great.
