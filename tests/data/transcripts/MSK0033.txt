P: No limp I can. I can walk OK.

D: OK and are you able to run?

P: Yeah I can. I can run, but when I do it it causes some pain. I'm able to still run but yeah it it hurts.

D: OK and. So when you palpate your lower knee just under the patella, you said it's a sharp pain, right?

P: Yeah exactly and then when I it's, and it feels kind of achey or when when, like after practice or something like that, but if you press on it it it's sharp.

D: And, uh. Any any kind of like are you able to flex and extend your knee right now if you tried?

P: I can yeah.

D:  OK and have you noticed any kind of rotation of your knee at all?

P: No, nothing like that. 

D: No OK. OK, and no weakness below your knee, right?

P: No weakness. I just feel like my muscles are really tight like my fly and my hamstring muscles. Think I need to stretch them out some more, they do just feel tight.

D: OK, and do you notice any kind of swelling or redness or bruising in the area?

P: No.

D:  no OK, and your ankle and hips you don't have any pain or issues with movement, right?

P: No, not at all. No, no problems with my ankle or hip.

D: OK alright yeah. So those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions?

P: I was just wondering what I can do to make this go away.

D: Yeah, so definitely this is something that is what we call Jumpers knee. It's fairly common, uh, amongst younger athletes, especially those that play sports like volleyball or basketball. But right now we don't really need to do any kind of imaging or anything like that. It seems like you're in the earlier phases and it's good that you came in. We definitely do need to manage it with some conservative management where we're going to keep having taking a look at it as well as I would recommend icing it every, like for half an hour, like around four to six times a day, especially after you're doing your activities. Then you can you can take the, continue taking the Tylenol and Advil, as well. As long as you're following the maximum amount per day depending on if you're taking extra strength Tylenol for example versus the regular strength. And then I will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will kind of a teach you some strengthening and stretching exercises that you can do to help what we call like that you will you might be having is just um some inflammation in your patellar tendon, right below your patella. So we need to strengthen the muscles around it. So we'll do some referral to physiotherapy and then we'll see how you you do based on all those treatment options and then if it gets worse and if or if it doesn't get better, we might need to do some imaging, either ultrasound or an MRI and then see where to go from there. But for now does that sound OK with you?

P: It does, yeah, thank you. So you said that you think it's like a patellar tendonitis or something like that?

D: Yeah, it's patellar tendonitis is commonly called the jumpers knee and it should resolve with the steps that we, especially since it seems like you're in the earlier stages. So it seems like it should be pretty responsive, but if it isn't, there are other steps we can discuss in the future.

P: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.
