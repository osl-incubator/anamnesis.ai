D: How may I help you?

P: Um I'm here because I've had some numbness in my right hand and uh doesn't seem to be going going away, so I thought I should get it checked out by you. 

D: Yeah, certainly so, so when did this exactly start? 

P: Um so it's been pretty gradual, I would say over the past month or two months um is when I first noticed it, but the numbness is definitely worse now than it was at the start.

D: OK, and uh where is this um the pain and numbness, where are you feeling it exactly?

P: Um it's particular, it's the worst on my thumb and index finger.

D: OK, do you feel it on your ring finger or uh, or sorry or your middle finger?

P: Um there is a little bit on my middle and ring finger, but it's like it's very very mild.

D: OK. Uh, and uh, like how long, is, are the symptoms constant or or are they intermittent?

P: Um I would say it's somewhat constant, but it's worse when um when I'm trying to like hold the steering wheel or using my phone, or you know, reading a book.

D: OK, I see, and um is there anything that you do uh at those times, to try to help get the symptoms to go away?

P: Um I guess I like shake out my hand um or yeah, try to put pressure on those numb, numb areas.

P: Uh maybe slightly.

D: OK. And uh like how would you describe the the pains in your hand, like dull, achy, sharp?

D: OK. OK, and uh is is there anything, so you mentioned sort of the driving and using your phone, are there any other activities that make it worse?

P: Um so, in my right hand, um I guess the you know the fleshy part of your thumb just above your wrist, um that seems to be um I guess atrophied compared to my left hand.

P: Mhmm.

D: OK, and are you feeling any temperature changes, like does the, any areas of the hand or wrist feel warm or hot?

P: Um no.

P: Uh yeah I can do that.

P: That hurts, or like that causes the tingling.

D: OK, um are there any any issues with like moving your elbow or your shoulder?

P: No.

D: OK, and if you take your opposite hand, um with just your uh kind of pointer finger and middle finger and just really tap, um right near the wrist crease called the Tinel's test, you tap there. Do you feel any reproduction of symptoms?

P: Yeah, that that causes the tingling.

D: OK, so you're positive Tinel's test, and um if you kind of place your wrist so that um like the backs of your hands are facing each other so that your wrists are flexed downwards and your um, your wrists are flexed and your fingers are pointing towards the ground and you just hold that position for a period of time. Um do you feel any pain?

P: Uh I guess a little bit of tingling.

D: OK, so that would be a positive Phalen's test as well. Um and range of motion of the neck, do you have any problems with that or any pain there?

P: No. 

D: OK. Um I think that was everything I wanted to ask about and check on the exam. Did you have any questions for me?

P: Um no, no questions. Thank you so much.

D: Alright, you're welcome, yeah, so it sounds like this could be uh carpal tunnel syndrome and uh so we we may depending on uh kind of like nerve studies to confirm the diagnosis, and um things that you can do in the meantime would be to use like a splint or um yeah, try to use like nighttime splints and activity modification as well.

P: OK, yeah, that sounds good.
