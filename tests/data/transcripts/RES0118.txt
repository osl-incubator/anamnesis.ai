I know it's a bit concerning because of the pandemic going on and um a runny nose can be a symptom uh of Covid as well, but uh it can also be a symptom of just the common cold or any other virus. Um but since you're having, uh you're symptomatic right now, we will definitely get like a Covid swab test done for you.

P: OK.

D: And if you start having any, just monitor for your symptoms. Um you should have the test back within 48 hours. Until then, uh at least for 14 days you should try to isolate in your own room, wear a mask around uh your partner, uh and not go outside, so just self isolate.

P: OK. 

D: And and then you will get the test results back in a, hopefully in a few days. So do you have any questions at all?

P: Uh no, thank you, that was good.

D: Take care, bye

P: You too.
