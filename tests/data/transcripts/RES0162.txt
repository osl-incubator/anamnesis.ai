D: What brings you in today?

P: Hi, I am just coming in because for the last couple of months but I've been having this, these coughing fits. Are there like when I'm going to the gym or even at home, like during the weekends when we're vacuuming and cleaning the house.

D: When did this start?

P: Um, I would say started, uh probably 3 months back, but it's gotten worse, so like before I used to like just have some irritation in my throat and cough a little, but now, I would say probably every other day I'm having these episodes where I can't stop coughing when I'm exercising.

D: Hmm, um and is this cough a dry cough, or do you bring up some mucus?

P: It's usually, it's usually a dry cough and sometimes I do bring up like this light material, but usually it's mostly a dry cough.

D: You never notice any blood, right?

P: No, no blood.

D: OK and uhm, it started about three months ago, I guess before that did you ever have a problem when you would exercise or when you were vacuuming or cleaning, has this been a problem that has occurred for years and that's just something that you that got worse and now it's come to your attention? Or was it just very new and sudden, three months ago?

P: Um, it's fairly new. I've never really had this issue before although I have been like so like after the new year in the winter I, I, I wasn't much of the person who ran or exercised a lot. But I, I kind of needed a new goal to become more fit and active. So I notice that, I don't know, maybe that's why like, it is something new that I've been trying, but yeah, it's not been an issue before.

D: OK, and other than the the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms like a sore throat or itchy eyes? Itchy nose? Stuffy nose or runny nose? Anything like that?

P: No, none of those, but I did it, initially I used to get just an irritation in my throat. But now it's just more of a cough.

D: OK. Do you have, do you get any pain in your chest at all?

P: Uh, when I'm usually it goes away in 10-15 minutes but when I'm coughing a lot I do get some tightness.

D: OK. Do you ever feel like you're short of breath when you're coughing or otherwise?

P: I do find that it's harder to take a breath at those times.

D: Ok. Uhm and how long do these last for? Episodes last for?

P: Probably, uh 15 to 20 minutes and yeah, it's it's mainly just after I like often times over the last few weeks I've had to just stop doing what I'm doing, like exercising and just come home and rest.

D: Do you feel like your hearts beating really fast when that happens or you're sweating?

P: Yeah, yeah, I I feel like it's usually, I don't know if it's because of the exercise, but I have like a Fitbit and it's my my heart rate is much faster.

D: Uhm, OK. Alright. Have you had any other symptoms so anything, any pain in your belly or any nausea or vomiting?

D: Ok.

P: Now, while the University has closed down, and by that I've lived there all my life before, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it.
