D: OK, have you ever have you been on oxygen at all?

P: No, I haven't, but I feel like I could be right now. It's like, really, I'm short of breath.

D: Yeah, yeah, we can definitely do that here. Uhm, alright. So, given your symptoms, it sounds like maybe you're having a COPD exacerbation, potentially. Do you feel like you might have had contact with anyone who was sick? 

P: Not that I can think of.

D: OK, have you traveled at all, outside the country or outside the province?

P: No, I I've just been helping out at the golf course, but that's all. Kind of outside.

D: Are you wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing?

P: Yeah, we are like, I'm like helping out with cleaning the carts and kind of helping out with the grounds.

D: Mhmm, OK, alright. So we'll do a Covid swab here just in case. And seeing that you're not feeling very well, you might require oxygen, we're going to keep you here in the ER, and we might have to, you might have to be hospitalized. We'll measure your vitals, do a physical exam, do a chest x-ray and you might be having, as I mentioned earlier, in exacerbation, upper COPD or a worsening of your COPD, potentially because you might have an infection, either a viral infection or bacterial infection that can sometimes worsen your COPD symptoms. You might be started on an antibiotic we'll be putting you in oxygen and giving you some steroid some, are you actually about that, are you, are you using any puffers at home?

P: Ah, yeah, so yeah I have been using uh, sorry I I have been using ventolin and there was a daily inhaler, Spiriva, I believe. I've been using that each day.

D: OK great great yeah so we'll be, we'll be giving you some puffers here as well, and yeah, we'll see how things go. Do you have any questions?

P: Uh, no, that that sounds good. Thank you.

D: OK, alright.
