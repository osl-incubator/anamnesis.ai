P: Uh no. 

D: OK. Have you have you been in contact with someone who you think could potentially be sick?

P: Uh, no, not that I know of. I do I do go to work in, like in person. Unfortunately I'm I can't work from home. But I've been noticing anyone sick around me though. 

D: And what do you do for work?

P: So I work at like a car shop. 

D: OK. And do you wear a mask and maintain social distancing?

P: Yeah, most of the times I would say we're pretty strict, strict with that. Uhm, sometimes when we're in our office I take off my mask, but usually when we're seeing other people or within close proximity, we keep the masks on.

P: Not that I know of, no. 

D: Any medical conditions that run in the family?

P: Uhm so I think, uh, diabetes, and for my family, but I I I don't have it so and I think that's pretty much about it on my dad's side. On my mom's side and there was someone, like my aunt did have ovarian cancer.

D: OK, and have you, I guess have you, I forgot to ask earlier, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations?

P: Uhm I had a surgery to remove my appendix in my 20s and since then, no. No surgeries or hospitalizations.

D: OK.  Alright, and I guess that's all the questions I have for you. You haven't had any difficulties breathing right? 

P: No, 

D: No, OK. Do you OK? And you've had diarrhea for two days. How's your appetite and have you been eating and drinking OK?

P: Uhm appetites pretty OK, like I feel like, I've been more hungry, with the carry I feel like I, need to eat more.

D: Uhm, It's also important with the diarrhea to drink lots of fluids and to make sure that you're not losing important minerals and you're not losing like sodium or potassium in diarrhea and other things like calcium that could create problems. So, continue to eat well and continue to drink lots of water. I guess so what we'll do is we'll do a COVID swab just to just to check if you have COVID or not. We'll also do a few labs to see how your electrolytes are, do your vitals to see if you have fever, measure your heart rate and do a physical exam and then go from there. And I'll off - I'll talk to my attending as well and we'll come back and discuss the management plan with you.

P: OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.
