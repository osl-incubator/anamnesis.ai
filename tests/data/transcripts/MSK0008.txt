D: OK. Uhm and next is there any changes to temperature like the joint itself feel hot?

P: No. 

D: OK and are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is painful to palpation?

P: At just the medial part of it like the I guess where the ligament would be.

D: OK, so just let me OK, and, any pain over the patella?

P: No. 

D: Any pain over the tibial tuberosity or patellar tendon?

P: No.

D: Any pain over your over the fibular head or the lateral part of the knee?

P: No.

D: Any pain in the calf or the thigh muscles?

P: No.

D: Any pain in the hamstring muscles?

P: No.

D: OK, and is there any pain to a like varus stress of the knee?

P: To the varus stress? I guess it would be, there will be pain if I press down in that area.

D: OK, and is there any joint yeah, the joint laxity or pain too, like a valgus stress of the knee?

P: Yeah, so when I press when I do that it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect. 

D: OK. Uhm and does it feel is as though there's some like the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress? 

P: A little bit, yes.

D: OK. Uhm and is there any instability moving the tibia anteriorly, if you're like, pull it outwards?

P: Um no.

D: And how about if you pull the tibia posteriorly, any instability?

P: No. 

D: OK, um and the is their full range of motion of the knee?

P: Yes.

D: And full range of motion of the hip and ankle?

P: Yes. 

D: OK, um and do you have any like numbness, tingling or muscle weakness? 

P: No.

D: OK, and any sensory changes to the skin?

P: No, no.

D: OK and reflexes are normal. 

P: Mmmm

D: OK. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today?

P: Ah no, that was it. Just what can I do about my my knee?

D: Yeah, so right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain, or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories to help that pain and swelling. If the pain depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. 

P: OK.

D: But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks and so if it's more more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although that it's most likely an MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we will get any x-ray if things aren't improving.

P: OK, that sounds good, thank you.
