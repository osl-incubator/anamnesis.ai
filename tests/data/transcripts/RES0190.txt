D: OK, have you been going to school?

P: Yeah, right now it's online school right now due to the pandemic.

D: OK, and has anybody at home been sick or have you been around anybody who's been sick?

P: My brother did have like similar sore throat symptoms, I think maybe two weeks ago and he did get some medications from the doctor.

D: OK, so did he get antibiotics?

P: I think so. I think he got some antibiotics.

D: OK. Have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: Uh, no.

D: Alright and, I know if some people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Have you or any of your friends tried anything like that before?

P: No, no, nothing like that.

D: OK, and everything that we talk about is always confidential, so you can feel safe sharing with me, and so has there been any concerns with physical or emotional violence at home?

P: No, I feel pretty safe. My parents are pretty caring and loving.

D: OK, well that's excellent. And are you sexually active?

P: No.

D: OK, have you been sexually active in the past?

P: No, not at all.

D: OK. And now in the family, are there any conditions such as heart problems or lung problems that run in the family?

P: Uh, no. Like my parents are pretty healthy.

D: OK, uhm, and any cancers that run in the family?

P: No.

D: OK, and how's school going?

P: School is going pretty well, no real issues. It took some time and adjusting to the new online curriculum, but it's going pretty well now.

D: OK, well that's good. I'm glad that you been able to, uh, adjust. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask about on history today. Did you have anything else that you maybe wanted to add? Or that I maybe forgot to ask about?

P: No. I think that those are all the questions I had.

D: OK, so with your current symptoms right now with no cough, tonsillar exudate, a fever, also your age and the like swelling and redness that you notice in the back of your throat is likely a group a strep pharyngitis that's causing this. And with your exposure to your brother who also received antibiotics, could be potentially be a sick contact for you that you were around, so this would require antibiotics as well for yourself and we'll do a rapid strep antigen test to check for this and wait on the result for that because it it still could possibly be a viral illness and so that passes negative and we're thinking it's a viral illness then we might hold off on antibiotics for now and monitor symptoms. And if at any point things get worse like you start to get shortness of breath or your fever's getting worse and it's not, not being controlled, then we'll reeassess the situation.

P: OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.

D: Thank you.
