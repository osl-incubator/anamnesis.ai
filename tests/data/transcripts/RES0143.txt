D: Any recreational drugs?

P: Uh no.

D: Any uh, alcohol?

P: Uh, yeah, just not, not much right now, but like when I, when we were at school like we would drink on the weekends.

D: That's good. Alright, um, so it sounds like you've had a cough for the past two weeks and you uh, have developed a runny nose last week, and your mom was ill the week before. It's possible that you just have a common cold uh, and that symptoms will get better over time. But just in case, we would also like to do a COVID swab, um, to make sure that you, just to rule out COVID. In the meantime, I would request that you isolate, self isolate at home. Stay away from your parents as well. Um, the test results should come back in 24 to 48 hours and public health will give you a call if your results are positive and we'll let you know what to do. Um, we will also do a physical exam here and check your temperature to see if you have a fever at all and um, yeah, does that sound good to you?

P: Yeah, and will I need any like antibiotics for my cough?

D: Oh. Um, well, we, I guess, you said that you don't have a sore throat at all, right?

P: No. It's just that, I just feel like the coughs been just going on, like it would be nice to just get rid of it.

D: Well um, I'll do a physical exam, look inside your throat, look inside your mouth, sorry, and listen to your chest, and uh, ensure that nothing else is going on, that you don't have anything like, say, strep throat or mono or you don't have uh, pneumonia, uh, bacterial pneumonia, for instance. Oftentimes um, symptoms that you have are caused by viruses and don't need to be treated with antibiotics, uh, but I'll do a physical exam, and maybe have a look at your labs as well, and then decide accordingly.

P: Okay, sounds good, thank you.

D: Okay.
