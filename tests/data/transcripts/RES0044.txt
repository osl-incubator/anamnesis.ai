D: What brings you in?

P: Um I just uh I have, I have a cough that I've had for a couple of days and like normally if I had a cough or cold, I would just like stay home and rest, but just because you know there's like Covid I I wanted to make sure, like I wanted to get checked out.

D: Yeah, of course that that was a great idea. Thanks for coming in. Um how long have you had this cough for?

P: Uh it's like 2 days. Like maybe three days ago, I started to feel like my throat was dry and I was like, oh, maybe I need to drink more water or something and then the next day I started like actually coughing.

D: OK, OK, and have you tried anything for the cough, like um over the counter cough syrup or anything like that?

P: Uh like I have, I've just been drinking tea and just like tea with honey just to like make it feel better. I I didn't like take any medicine.

D: OK, and do you, have you noticed that there are any triggers for your cough, like the cold, or dust, or any like environmental triggers?

all the time right now.

P: Uh no, it's like a new a new building.

D: OK, OK, and do you think you may have been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?

P: Well, so um, I work uh in like, I work in an office that's attached to a factory um and I, so like I have to actually be there, I haven't been able to work from home. Um and there was someone else in my office that I think was coughing in that, like last week and I I don't know, I questioned it but I I didn't actually get to talk to them and ask them, or like I don't know if they were actually sick or something. So, I might have been, and we wear masks and everything, like we're really good, but I don't know, I feel like the offices aren't like super, like the air flow's not that great.

D: Yeah.

P: So yeah, I think that's another reason I was concerned, that I I feel like some people might have been sick and I didn't really know the whole story.

D: Right, OK, so potentially, from from the workplace then, OK.

P: Yeah.

D: And, OK, um have you traveled anywhere recently?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Well those were all the questions that I had for you today, was there um anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?

P: Uh not that I can think of.

D: No, OK. So right now it seems like, if I'm going through my differential diagnosis list for you, at the top is, the thing that we have to rule out is Covid, so we'll take a swab and send it off for those PCR results and you'll hear back either tomorrow or the day after, about the results. But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now. Um so we'll just start with that Covid swab for now. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, that that sounds great. That's really what it, like, I I don't feel super sick, I just really wanna know if I have Covid or not.

D: Yeah for sure and I, and I think it's good that you came in.

P: Awesome.

D: Alright, thank you.

P: OK thanks.
