P: No, nothing like that.

D: OK, so she's been growing well?

P: Yeah, she's been growing well. She's been gaining weight like a normal amount um and she's doing well, she was doing well at school.

D: OK. And um at home, uh what is the environment like?

P: Um she lives at home with both of us like um her mom and her dad, and uh she has a younger sibling who is 4 years old. 

D: OK. And um does anyone smoke in the house at all?

P: Um no, not anymore.

D: OK, um how long ago uh did someone smoke?

P: Um it was, um so her dad used to smoke um and he stopped when she was like 3.

D: OK, that's good. Um any kind of uh dust or mold or animals, uh anything in the household? 

P: No, we don't have any pets and um the place is just renovated so nothing like that.

D: OK. Alright, so yeah, those were just some of the questions that I had for her today. Do you have any questions or concerns?

P: Um yeah, so what can we do for her right now to make these symptoms go away?

D: Yeah, so what we should do for her right now is, she's seven years old, um what I'm thinking right now with her symptoms especially coming on after uh exertion, being worse in the winter, she may have asthma.

P: OK. 

D: And although she doesn't have any family history of it, it can happen without family history as well. Um so we would like to uh try and do uh what's called a pulmonary function test. That will help us kind of understand uh if she has um asthma or not and then we can try her on um, it's called a short acting beta agonist, so it's a puffer.

P: OK.

D: And uh usually when she gets these types of symptoms, she can use the puffer to help her. Uh and if it um helps her then it's most likely that she does have asthma and she will need um that puffer and then she might also need another puffer, which is an inhaled corticosteroid, um for the future to decrease um the likelihood that this asthma gets worse in the future.

P: OK, OK yeah thank you.

D: Yeah, no worries. So yeah, so yeah we'll get those tests done and then go from there.

P: OK, sounds great.

D: Take care.

P: You too.
