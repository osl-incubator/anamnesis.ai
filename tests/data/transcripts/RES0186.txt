D: Yeah, for sure, so that's kind of top on my list right now to rule out, so we will do a Covid swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. In the meantime, you should isolate for for about 14 days and if your symptoms get worse, go to the ER and if you're experiencing things like weakness, seizures like, and you're not getting any better in a couple of weeks, or you feel dehydrated. Otherwise, supportive care at home, keeping yourself hydrated, eating well, sleeping well, all of those will definitely help as well. Does that sound OK?

P: Yeah, it does. Thank you.

D: OK, yeah, no problem.
