P: So I live in a house with my um with my wife uh yeah and son.

D: OK, alright and, OK so now I'm just going to move on to the physical exam part of this um and I'm going to ask you to do a few things, OK? So, well just by looking at your legs, or if you have a mirror um and you can look at your right buttock area, um do you see any swelling or redness?

P: Um no, I don't see anything like that.

D: OK. And does it feel hot?

D: OK. And do you see any skin changes?

D: Um any atrophy or deformity in the area?

P: No.

D: No, um has your gait changed, like does it, are you limping, hobbling, anything like that?

P: Um yeah, I feel like I've been limping a little bit, uh yeah.

D: Are you putting more um pressure on the left foot then?

P: I am, yeah, yeah, I guess there's like an antalgic gait.

D: OK, alright, and then um if you press down on your hipbone, do you feel any pain there? On your right hip bone.

P: No, I don't.

D: OK, how about when you press down on your buttocks itself?

P: Um yeah, there is uh a little bit of tenderness um over the buttock area.

D: OK, how about the back of your legs?

P: No.

D: OK, how about the front um of your legs, thighs?

P: No.

D: No, OK. Alright, um and then I'm gonna just get you to do a few movements um with me as well. Would you uh OK, so are you sitting down right now?

P: Yeah.

D: OK. Would you mind standing up from a sitting position?

P: Yeah, for sure.

D: Does that hurt?

P: It uh yeah, that that that causes pain.

D: OK, so that causes, so um hip hip extension uh that causes some pain, um and as well as knee extension, so would you mind um kicking your right leg up in front of you all the way up as far as you can go?

P: Mhmm, oh yeah.

D: Does that hurt?

P: It does, yeah.

D: OK so right hip flexion um also causes pain, and then would you mind uh folding your knees backwards um and just sort of flexing it? Does that hurt?

P: Uh no.

D: OK, so no pain at knee flexion. And how about when you point your feet um and toes up towards the ceiling?

P: Uhm yeah I I do get some pain with my um, yeah when that's all straightened out, yeah.

D: OK, so some pain on um planter flexion of the right foot. And how about if you um point your feet and toes towards the ground?

P: No pain there.

D: OK, um alright and how about when you uh kick your legs uh to the side and upwards?

P: Oh uh no pain with abduction.

D: OK so no pain on right hip abduction, and then how about when you bring it back down?

P: No.

D: OK and no pain on hip adduction. OK, well those are all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions for myself?

P: Uh just wondering about possibly like what it could be.

D: Yeah, um so it sounds um right now like you may have some sort of uh sacral nerve radiculopathy um or or like a lower lumbar, lumbar um radiculopathy, um basically uh that's known as sciatica, uh where your nerve roots can be compressed, causing some of these symptoms. Um and to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam um but if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including um numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder incontinence, then we can look at some um imaging for the for the spine, including MRI. Um and so in terms of management of this, um we can try a couple couple of like conservative approaches first, so that includes taking NSAIDs uh for the pain um and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down um all the time, um perhaps like taking little breaks, uh stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well um during those breaks can help um, and as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy and they'll do some exercises with you and um slowly increase those exercises. Um and if those still don't work, we can try um steroids, steroid injections, um as well, we talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about 6 to 8 weeks. Does that sound OK?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

D: OK, yeah no problem.
