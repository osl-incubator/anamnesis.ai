D: OK. Alright, so these are all this questions I had for you today. We'll do a full physical examination next. Do you have any questions or concerns?

P: No.

D: OK, so yeah, right now one of the main things we want to rule out, especially since you had the sudden shortness of breath today after a history of just recent discharge and the hip fracture or injury, and you're immobilized we need to make sure you haven't developed a clot that has traveled to your lungs. So we'll do a full physical examination and get some blood work done initially and then see if you require any medications for if you need thrombolysis for to break up the clot. We'll, we might do some imaging as well, so yeah, well, we'll just start with that, and then we'll go from there.

P: Sure.

D: So you'll be in here for a few hours until we get all those things done and see if you need any admission at all to the hospital.

P: Sure.

D: Alright.

P: Thank you.

D: Welcome, take care.
