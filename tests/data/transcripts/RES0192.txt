P: Um were given a um personal protective equipment um for those concerns, but when I was younger I used to work a in shipyards and constructions and like old buildings and stuff, and I know there was some concern for not being ah properly equipped with the right equipment for protection and safety at that point so. Uh yeah, it's possible. I've been exposed to some things.


D: I see is there a chance that there could have been asbestos at any of those places that you worked?


P: Yeah, asbestos or mold. Yeah, you name it. Probably everything.


D: Yeah, I see this was like 10 years ago 20 years ago or or longer?


P: Yeah, and so it would have been. Yeah, about like 30 years ago or yeah 30, 40 years ago and. I worked in those places for 30 to 40 years, so. Around that time.

D: Well yeah, so at this time It will be important to get some lung imaging and and possibly, some other investigations as well because of your exposure uh to inhalants and fumes, and possibly asbestos.
