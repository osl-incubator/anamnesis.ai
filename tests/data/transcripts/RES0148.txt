D: And and for how long or for, when did you start smoking? Sorry.

P: Uh so I've been uh smoking since I was uh 20 years old, so about 30 years ago was when I started. 

D: OK and and have you could, have you thought of, have you tried to quit before?

P: Uhm I did, but then I just didn't. Uh I just went back to it. Um but I'm trying to cut down.

D: OK, uh it's good that you've been able to cut down, so congratulations on that. Um and do you drink alcohol?

P: Uhm I I do. Uh, I'll drink um sometimes with my friends maybe uh once a month or once in two three months. Um but I haven't been going out with them since the pandemic started, so I haven't had much to drink. I haven't had anything to drink um since the past year.

D: OK. Um I see. And uh have you had any um history of heart or lung conditions in the family?

P: No.

D: OK, yeah, and I think that that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on on history today before we go ahead on to the physical exam. Uh did you have anything that you wanted to add maybe before um that I forgot to ask about?

P: Uh no.

D: OK, um so we will start with um some investigations, including a a Covid swab today, just because of your uh general symptoms which do overlap with with Covid, um although it could as you mentioned uh be something like the common cold um as well. Um and so we will uh be sure to test for Covid and in the meantime we ask you to self isolate um for for 14 days, um and we will get back the results um as soon as we can, and if your symptoms get worse at any point, um then we will uh act accordingly.
