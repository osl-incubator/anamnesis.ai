D: OK, could you tell me specifically where you're feeling the pain?

P: I would say it's mostly at the back of my throat.

D: OK, and how long has this been going on for?

P: I think it started last night.

D: OK. And how would you describe the pain? Is sharp, burning, stinging, dull?

P: I would describe it as like a burning pain.

P: Uh, I think it's just staying at the back of my throat.

D: OK, and can you think of anything that triggered the the sore throat that you did just prior to the symptoms coming on?

P: Uh, no, not that I can think of. I haven't really changed what I drink or what I eat. Nothing really changed.

D: OK, and anything that's been making the pain worse?

P: Um, I would say when I, uh, especially when I'm eating when I'm swallowing, it hurts a lot, but that's about it.

D: OK. Anything that makes it better?

P: Uh, I I think when I drink like colder liquids or ice cream, it just soothes he pain a little bit.

D: OK. Any other symptoms that you been experiencing?

P: Um, so I I do find that like my mom told me, that I have my voice is kind of rough and like just a little bit hoarse. But other than that, besides the swallowing, um, nothing else really. I'm still able to swallow liquids but it's just the solids that causes some pain.

D: OK, have you had anything to eat today or when was the last time you had anything to eat?
