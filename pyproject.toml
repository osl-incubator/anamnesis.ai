The system will leverage the capabilities of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), the ChatGPT API, Flask (a micro web framework written in Python), and SQLite (a lightweight database) to facilitate an interactive, user-friendly platform for collecting patient medical history (anamnesis) through conversational AI."
